_ _I&#8217;m currently writing as a freelancer on a range of topics from weddings to crowdfunding. Yep, that&#8217;s writing for hire. It&#8217;s not the most lucrative gig in town compared to my other work, but pays for cocktails and spices.&nbsp;_  
_  
_ _I&#8217;m also writing a novel as most people are aware from the side bar on my blog.&nbsp;_
