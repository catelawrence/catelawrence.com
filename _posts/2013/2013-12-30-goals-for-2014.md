-   Learn to swim. Yes, I can swim, I’ve grown up around swimming pools, creeks and trips to rivers and lakes all my life. But I want to be able to swim well. To do freestyle without running out of breath and backstroke without bashing my arm into the side of the pool. Maybe even graduate from the slow lane to medium lane.

-   Get my hair cut short. See above. Less hair means less pool hair

-   Spend less time in front of screens and more time in the garden

-   Celebrate the good times and my successes more. As a small NFP owner, it’s so easy to focus on looking forward at what’s coming up next.

-   Cook more <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">vegan food plant based food. I tried being vegan for a long time but it didn’t really work for me. My love of cheese and disdain for the imported, packaged and heavily processed soy products that depict much vegan food had something to do with it. Not to mention that I can only eat a limited amount of soy due to thyroid issues under medical advisement and soy sneaks it’s way into so many foods, especially of the vegan ilk. I won’t be doing NO soy but focusing on making stuff from scratch.

-   Spend more time with friends. More day trips, more dinner parties, more weekends away.

-   Finish, edit and self publish my first novel. I started it during Nanowrimo and will be writing each day in January.

-   Complete a quilt or two.

-   Try a new recipe or cooking technique a week

-   Learn to take quality food photos. Mine usually look terrible!

-   Become a board member of a not for profit I admire.
