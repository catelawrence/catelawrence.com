<i ><br /></i>I have advertising on my blog (pretty obvious) which helps fund the cost of hosting my blog. I allow&nbsp;<span style="color: #5d5454; letter-spacing: 0.5px; line-height: 21.125px;">third-party companies to serve ads and/or collect certain anonymous information when you visit our web site or mobile application. These companies may use non-personally identifiable information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or third party web beacon to collect this information. To learn more about this behavioural advertising practice or to opt-out of this type of advertising, you can visit https://www.networkadvertising.org.
