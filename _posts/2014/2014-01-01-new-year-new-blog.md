After a long hiatus, I have decided to start blogging again. Why? I like making lists, taking photos and writing.

What will I write about?
  
Not entirely sure yet. I&#8217;ll tell you a bit about what I am up to, the process of writing my novel, new recipes, books I am reading, a few photos. It&#8217;ll be fun!
