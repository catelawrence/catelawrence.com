<br>
_Ingredients_

-   500g self raising flour (or gluten free and baking soda).
-   180g cocoa
-   100g sugar (more to taste)
-   2 medium beetroot, grated
-   100ml olive oil
-   350ml orange juice
-   1.5 tablespoons baking powder
-   250g silken tofu

<br>
<br>
_Instructions_

<br>

1.  Preheat the oven to 180°C and grease and line a 22cm cake tin (it's easier if you've got a loose-bottomed one).
2.  Sift the flour and cocoa together into a mixing bowl.
3.  Add the sugar and grated beetroot and mix to combine.
4.  Blend together the oil, juice, baking powder and tofu, until it has a smooth texture and is well combined.
5.  Add this to the dry ingredients and stir to combine. Then pour this into the cake tin and cook in the oven for 1.25 – 1.5 hours.
6.  Check the cake after 1 hour by inserting a skewer into it – if it comes out clean the cake is ready. The cake will come out of the oven slightly cracked on top, but smelling wonderful.
7.  Leave to cool on a wire rack and serve with the spiced beetroot glaze.

_Ingredients_

-   1 litre water
-   1 medium beetroot, cut into 2 cm cubes
-   1 cinnamon quill
-   1/2 cup sugar
-   1 vanilla pod, split in 2
-   1/2 teaspoon ground allspice

<br>
_Instructions_

<br>

1.  Place all the ingredients in a saucepan.
2.  Bring to the boil and then gently simmer for 30 minutes.
3.  Strain the mixture, reserving the liquid.
4.  Add the beetroot back to the strained liquid and then blend this together.
5.  Pour the glaze back into the pan and heat for a further 2 minutes.
6.  Allow to cool a little and drizzle over cake.
