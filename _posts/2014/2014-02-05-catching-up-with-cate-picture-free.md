Bit of a quiet albeit all over the place week this week. I had my mobile phone stolen from a cafe a couple of days ago so I haven&#8217;t been able to take photos of all the yummy foods I&#8217;ve been making (almond milk, cashew yogurt, tempeh) in preparation for this weekend&#8217;s class. Lots of fermenting which I enjoy and cooking of soy beans.



I&#8217;m also trying to sort through the zillion different gluten free flours I have to combine and make something edible. A quick (too scared to delve too deeply) peruse of the shelf in the pantry and I found:
  
-Maize
  
-Almond
  
-Corn
  
-Tapioca
  
-Chickpea
  
-Rice
  
-Wheat flours.

Will need to do some research. I was in a wholefoods store yesterday (buying Nutritional Yeast) and I saw pea and lentil flour. Curiouser and curiouser!

Still trying to cull household stuff in preparation for the move to Germany. I really should be working on my appalling language skills. I&#8217;ve been struggling a lot with insomnia which doesn&#8217;t help my focus and concentration.

Busy working on a few different workshops and organising a _Preserving the  Harvest_ event in March in Northcote where people can come and learn but also teach their own recipes. Will make a poster tomorrow I think. I&#8217;ve also got a heap of workshops over the next few weeks with the [Sustainable Living Festival](https://www.slf.org.au/festival14/). Green Renters are not doing a stall this year at the Festival, like many people we speak to, we find that the &#8216;big weekend&#8217; tends to attract the converted and it&#8217;s been blisteringly hot and unpleasant the last two years which has dropped numbers. A lot of (unpaid) effort for little return.

Going for my first swimming lesson tomorrow night, a Christmas gift from my husband. I can swim, just with rather poor technique. I&#8217;m hoping it will help with my breathing and build up my stamina to swim more than a handful of laps. I enjoy swimming, quite meditative.

Better fly, off to dinner with a friend.
