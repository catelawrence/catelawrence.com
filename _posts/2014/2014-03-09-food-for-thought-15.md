Really look forward to a weekend away with my beloved next week. We&#8217;re going to Hobart and it&#8217;ll be our last holiday before we move. I love Tasmania, especially the amazing cheese and fresh produce!



I&#8217;ve a list of new recipes I&#8217;m intending to make over the next few weeks once I get  the time. These include:

  * Bean and chocolate brownies
  * Corn tortillas
  * Soda bread
  * [my own vinegar plant](https://down---to---earth.blogspot.com.au/%20raw%20unpasteurised%20vinegar) ( go through soooo much vinegar in pickling and relish making).


  <i>Some things that have intrigued me over the last week:</i>






  <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2014/03/07/wanted-volunteers-to-knit-little-woolly-jumpers-for-poorly-penguins-4445647/">Multiple call outs for penguin jumpers</a>. Turns out the jumpers aren&#8217;t actually for the penguins in the most instances and the are used to dress fundraiser soft toys like the ones below. You can read more about it at <a href="https://www.giantflightlessbirds.com/2011/10/the-great-penguin-sweater-fiasco/">The Great Penguin Sweater Fiasco</a> by Mike Dickison

Speaking of knitting (something I lack patience for), I am charmed by this [snail tea cosy](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/snail-tea-cosy) by Anke Klempner:

<a style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;" href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-pzLjsnyXTTg/Uxq1Zi9wmWI/AAAAAAAAIVI/J4b2eVuIkLA/s1600/red_snail_whole_medium2.jpg"><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-pzLjsnyXTTg/Uxq1Zi9wmWI/AAAAAAAAIVI/J4b2eVuIkLA/s1600/red_snail_whole_medium2.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="332" border="0" /></a>

The issue of working for free comes up in a lot of not for profit and social enterpreneurial organisations. I often get asked to provide workshops and presentation for free, usually for big NFP&#8217;s with hundreds of staff and sizable budget. The staff who attend on the night get paid, the caterer gets paid, the drinks supplier gets paid, why shouldn&#8217;t I? A critical look at the issue is presented by Jessica Gottlieb in [The Problem is that My Job is Your Hobby](https://jessicagottlieb.com/2014/03/the-problem-is-that-my-job-is-your-hobby/)

I&#8217;m a big fan of Rohan Anderson&#8217;s work. Whilst I don&#8217;t agree with everything he says and does and at times find his work unbearably hipster (this could be perhaps unfortunate timing more than anything), his books and [blog](https://wholelarderlove.com/) are also beautifully photographed. I suspect the culprit might be his wife Kate Berry who now has a charming photography project sharing her rural Victoria work with another photographer called Kate Berry in London. Check out [The Other Kate Berry](https://www.theotherkateberry.com/) for some stunning pics.

I also think this [campaign by Catapult](https://www.catapult.org/coverstories/) to address the issue is female child slavery for International Women&#8217;s Day is very clever.
