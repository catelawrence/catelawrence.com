A lot of people have been asking me lately if we are taking Mr Pablo to Leipzig with us. The answer is, of course! We&#8217;re in the middle of the process right now. He had his rabies vaccination this morning and a new microchip as his old one of 17 years is obsolete. Â Once we move I&#8217;ll write a bit about our experiences and how to move a cat from Australia to Europe.
