  Bit of a weird week this week. I went to see the vascular surgeon on Wednesday after seeing the specialist physio the week before. Thursday morning I got a call, I was booked in for surgery the following day! I had a bilateral fasciotomy to treat <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartment_syndrome">compartment syndrom</a>e. It&#8217;s basically a condition where one&#8217;s lower legs feel chronic pain or tightness and the only way to treat it is to cut the fascia vertically. I&#8217;ve tried a lot of other treatment (including six pairs of orthotics) and it&#8217;s such a relief to be accurately diagnosed and treated. I won&#8217;t post a link about the surgery as they all involve pictures which don&#8217;t look great!

  Due to my limited finances I was able to do it as day surgery which was great as I didn&#8217;t have to stay overnight in hospital.  I  had a weird reaction coming out of the anaesthetic and had to be sedated. Oops. The pain is now manageable thanks to the painkillers though I have to keep the dressing on for a week. I&#8217;m actually teaching workshops everyday this week, luckily I can do it sitting down and I&#8217;ve got some helpers for part of the week!






   If you are in the area, come visit me at <a href="https://www.vicgardenssc.com.au/">Victoria Gardens Shopping Centre</a> between 12pm and 1:30pm next week! I&#8217;ll be teaching ways a few different things:

  Here&#8217;s a few things that are holding my attention this week:



  How amazing are <a href="https://www.thejealouscurator.com/blog/2014/05/05/tiffanie-turner/">these</a> flowers? Hard to believe they are made out of paper!

  Loving <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2014/05/08/blast-off/">these</a> images of children&#8217;s reference books in the 1970&#8217;s.

  I&#8217;m teaching a vegan roast masterclass in June as part of the Melbourne Food and Wine Festival&#8217;s June Roast series. You can find out more about it here<a href="https://greenrenters.org/civicrm/event/info?reset=1&id=470">https://greenrenters.org/civicrm/event/info?reset=1&id=470</a>. I was interviewed by a journo from <i>The Age</i> about it earlier in the week so hopefully it&#8217;ll get enough bookings to run. By the way if anyone has a good source for vital gluten flour, let me know! I&#8217;ve rang many health food shops and am struggling to find it IRL stores (I like to give everyone info on where to find things).

I love the idea of visible mending but unfortunately most of my clothes are a bit too far gone by the time I get to it. I even included some works of it in an exhibition I curated a few years ago:

[Tom of Holland](https://tomofholland.com/category/the-visible-mending-programme/) has some great imagery and resources that are fantastic!
