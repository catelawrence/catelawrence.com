I&#8217;ve been a terribly neglectful blogger.

The surgery knocked me around a bit.  I ended up with an infection in my right leg and a trip to emergency, all of which has not been fun. I had all the stitches out this week at last although I&#8217;m on another round of antibiotics and still have to wear a dressing on my leg so no baths for me sadly. My left leg is good although I think I&#8217;ll end up heading the posterior compartment released at some stage. The scarring will be minimal due to the keyhole surgery, the actual cuts go from knee to ankle.



I&#8217;ve been struggling terribly with a spot of plantar fascitis (the condition is a bitch to treat effectively) but besides that my leg pain is gone. It&#8217;s very strange, my body keeps tensing waiting for the pain and being able to walk differently takes a lot of getting used to!                                  <a style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;" href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-iItjfkrCFLM/U4_pDfV3ygI/AAAAAAAAIwg/xIkHL82EZCA/s1600/10336639_10152048156036249_3859044767034588079_n.jpg"><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-iItjfkrCFLM/U4_pDfV3ygI/AAAAAAAAIwg/xIkHL82EZCA/s1600/10336639_10152048156036249_3859044767034588079_n.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="320" border="0" /></a>

We&#8217;ve just under a month before we leave for Leipzig. We&#8217;re frantically clearing out the house, selling  and donating bits and pieces. It&#8217;s quite a large job, especially once you start selling off furniture and end up living out of boxes and using the laundromat. But it&#8217;s all part of the adventure!

_<span style="font-size: x-small;"> Getting rid of my succulents, I really enjoyed finding the little teapots and teacups_

I did my last preserving class in Australia. It was a great day and there was quite a haul (apologies for a somewhat blurry phone pic):

  Besides that I&#8217;ve just been busy organising our last few Green Renters events and workshops and making door snakes. I was hopeful of taking a finished hexagon quilt to Germany but it will have to be completed there.

  Here&#8217;s one of the vegan Portuguese custard tarts I made this week.I&#8217;ll be serving them as part of morning tea at our vegan masterclass this weekend.
