I&#8217;ve been an absent blogger but this time, with good reason, I&#8217;ve moved countries! Chris, Mr Pablo and I now reside in Leipzig, Germany. We&#8217;ve been here just over 2 weeks, and it&#8217;s certainly been a ride.



How&#8217;s it all going? I&#8217;ll divide into good and bad in dot point form to give you a wee snap shot. I&#8217;ve had a rotten lurgy so have been too unwell to explore much or cook much so my lens is somewhat limited to local haunts.
  
<br /> <b>Bad (and some good)</b>
  
<br /> 

  * I left my mobile phone on the plane to Frankfurt. Despite contacting the appropriate authorities it was never handed in. And it&#8217;s not worth much either. Luckily Chris sent a phone to his Dad in the UK which he doesn&#8217;t use so he&#8217;s posting it to me. Hence the lack of photos
  * We had major dramas with the Lufthansa and Mr Pablo. In short, he was left in Frankfurt whilst we flew to Leipzig. I caught a train back the next day (four hours each way) and spent 5 hours in animal cargo/customs/animal cargo/ et al. All of these places were a fair distance from the main airport and required driving to each. Yes, neither the airline or pet travel company detailed any of this. Stressful, very stressful. I was very lucky to befriend a kindly cab driver who spoke English and really helped me out. In his own time for free. As we&#8217;d caused a bit of a rucus at Lufthansa the day before when we realised Mr P wasn&#8217;t loaded onto the plane. I also had a lovely Lufthansa animal staffer called Armando helping me out. It&#8217;s when you depend on the kindness of strangers that you really value goodness in people.
  * <span style="background-color: white; color: #37404e; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 20px;">I developed a rotten sore throat and ear infection and bad cough a couple of days after arriving. Probably the same lurgy that struck everyone back home. I needed to see a doctor and did a google for doctors who could speak some English. 

  * <span style="background-color: white; color: #37404e; line-height: 20px;">Ah the joy of the German medical system. Appointments could only be made by an online form and the place was closed all weekend. Despite sending two requests for an appointment I received no reply. So went down to the clinic which looked like a weird hospital DDR style. The receptionist was dressed in white and didn&#8217;t speak English (fair enough). We were all offered tea and coffee in the waiting ro<span style="background-color: white; color: #37404e; display: inline; line-height: 20px;">om. Called in to see a student doctor perhaps in her 50&#8217;s. Explained symptoms and asked how to say ear in Deutsch. She suggested holding my nose and exhaling repeatedly with my mouth closed. I explained I had tried this repeatedly and my ears have been ringing at a high volume for days and are extremely painful. Then her supervisor came in (wearing shorts and t shirt hehe) and changed the battery of the ear checker, digging it far enough into my ear that I screamed. He then showed the student comparable pictures of ear infections on google pics and pointed to mine. They decided that a nasal spray from the chemist would work and if it wasn&#8217;t better in 2 days go back for a prescription for  &#8216;very serious treatment-&#8216; antibiotics. I&#8217;m cursing myself for not bring a pack with me from Australia. It&#8217;s times like this I miss Brunswick Betta Health, as crap as it was. That said, the appointment was free and the nasal spray was 2€. It contains water and essential oils.  ( I returned for another visit and since my hearing is still impaired, I received a script for antibiotics and a referral for an ear specialist if the antibiotics don&#8217;t fix it).
  * <span style="background-color: white; color: #37404e; display: inline; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 20px;">The chemist was like going to a liquor shop with no booze on show. There were sweets and bandages but I couldn&#8217;t see any drugs. If you are planning a trip to Deutschland bring all the drugs. Upon advice of other expats I took 6 months worth of my prescription meds with me to Leipzig.
  * <span style="background-color: white; color: #37404e; display: inline; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 20px;">It&#8217;s been really hot. 36c today which is of course, not as hot as Melbourne but there&#8217;s no air con anywhere. Poor Mr P in his winter coat!


  <span style="color: #37404e;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 20px;"><b>Things that are just a bit weird or different</b>



  <ul>
    <li>
      <span style="color: #37404e; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 20px;">We only have one key for the apartment, for both of us. We are not allowed to copy the key. I am terrified of losing the key. When we next leave the country we will try get some copies made overseas. 
    </li>
    <li>
      <span style="color: #37404e; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 20px;">Supermarkets are interesting. Each supermarket has at least three full aisles of booze and a comparative amount of meat. I have never seen so much meat in my life in all it&#8217;s forms. I have bought some vegan bratwurst however. 
    </li>
    <li>
      <span style="color: #37404e; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 20px;">You get charged a tax on any bottles (glass or plastic) that you buy. These can returned to the store for a refund. 
    </li>
    <li>
      <span style="color: #37404e;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 20px;">Despite scouring supermarkets and health food shops, I am unable to find bicarbonate soda in quantities bigger than 50g, more than single sachets of yeast or baking powder, ice cube trays or shower puffers 
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  
    <span style="color: #37404e; line-height: 20px;"><i>(these things)</i><a style="line-height: 20px; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;" href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/--7XxyMHTOeI/U8vVAtKbdfI/AAAAAAAAI8Q/8cQw_S_884g/s1600/Bath-Puffs-20901.jpg"><img src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/--7XxyMHTOeI/U8vVAtKbdfI/AAAAAAAAI8Q/8cQw_S_884g/s1600/Bath-Puffs-20901.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="239" border="0" /></a><span style="color: #37404e; line-height: 20px;"> <br /> <span style="color: #37404e; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 20px;">I am debating whether to wait until I go to the UK next or buy all of the above on ebay. 
  
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <span style="color: #37404e;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 20px;">Sausages are hugely popular. Even when a sausage stall is located next to indian and thai restaurants for the same price, people will opt for the sausages. 
    </li>
    <li>
      <span style="color: #37404e;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 20px;">Ice cream parlours are very popular, serving huge sundaes. I have enjoyed a few due to lurgy recovery. Great gelato!
    </li>
    <li>
      <span style="color: #37404e;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 20px;">Downloading aka torrenting is heavily penalised. We have a proxy but I miss being able to d/l at whim.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <b>The Good</b>



  <ul>
    <li>
      Despite speaking very little German I can generally get by. Chris is fluent and I am keen to do a proper intensive course once the schools reopen in August. I have done German lessons in Australia, it&#8217;s just hard to remember! Unlike Berlin, most people don&#8217;t speak English unless they are younger. 
    </li>
    <li>
      There&#8217;s a fruit and veg market twice a week in the town square with lovely fruit, veg, bread, flowers etc.
    </li>
    <li>
      Booze at the supermarket is ridiculously cheap. When you go out, beer is the cheapest followed by wine, mixed spirits (like a gin and tonic) are expensive by Australian standards but the wine is good. 
    </li>
    <li>
      Buffet brunch is really popular here on the weekends. I love brunch! 
    </li>
    <li>
      It&#8217;s great living in the city and being close to things. It&#8217;s a walk to shopping centres, the town square, cafes and restaurants etc
    </li>
    <li>
      Our cargo arrived without any damage. 
    </li>
    <li>
      Yesterday I found the Leipzig version of Brunswick st/Smith st in Melbourne. A big second hand store like Savers where I bought a skirt, plenty of bars and interesting restaurants. It&#8217;s 8 tram stops from our house, nice and close. 
    </li>
    <li>
      My ears are still blocked but my throat is better and hopefully I&#8217;ll be well enough next week to get stuck into working on my book.
    </li>
  </ul>
