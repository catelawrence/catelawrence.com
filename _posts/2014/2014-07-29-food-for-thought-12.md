[This](https://www.thefader.com/2014/07/25/cory-arcangel-working-on-my-novel/) book reminds me of me, working on my novel (slowly)



[Can bloggers live off rainbows and hugs?](https://decor8blog.com/2014/07/18/can-full-time-bloggers-live-off-of-rainbows-hugs/), Holly Becker, Decor8

[Is Freelancing a Lonely Business](https://www.theguardian.com/money/work-blog/2014/jul/22/freelancing-lonely-business), Liz Parry, The Guardian

[David Lynch now has a line of women&#8217;s sportswear](https://shop.livetheprocess.com/collections/david-lynch-collection). Weird.

You can see some of my favourite places to eat in Melbourne [here](https://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/chefs-tell-us-their-50-best-cheap-eats-in-melbourne/story-fnkd6ppg-1227004711319). Sadly _[Camy Shanghai Dumpling Noodle Restaurant](https://www.au.timeout.com/melbourne/restaurants/venues/470/camy-shanghai-dumpling-and-noodle-restaurant)_ is not mentioned!

_Silo by Joost_ replaced by [_Brothl_](https://www.goodfood.com.au/good-food/food-news/silo-by-joost-becomes-bone-broth-canteen-brothl-20140725-3cjhp.html)_,_ looks really interesting! I&#8217;m not big on meat based dishes but I think it&#8217;s a clever way to address food waste. You can see the menu [here](https://byjoost.com/silo/food-drink/).

I&#8217;ve always been blown away by the work of Ron Muek. How can you not be? I was lucky to see some in Melbourne a few years ago. This is not a new [article](https://www.thisiscolossal.com/2013/05/new-hyperrealistic-sculptures-by-ron-mueck/) but rather new to me.

Very pleased to see another [interview](https://creosotejournal.com/2014/07/endbahnhof-photographic-portraits-of-berlins-u-bahn/) with my friend Kate. I look forward to owning her book someday!

[This](https://www.sunnyskyz.com/blog/364/People-Post-Selfies-Other-People-Draw-Them-I-Can-t-Stop-Laughing#YmKdWFqf1xjziYu6.01) website made me giggle. And did you know there&#8217;s a big [Goth Festival](https://www.wave-gotik-treffen.de/english/) in Leipzig every year? There&#8217;s quite a few gothic clothing shops and clubs so [this](https://gothsinhotweather.blogspot.de/) make me lol.
