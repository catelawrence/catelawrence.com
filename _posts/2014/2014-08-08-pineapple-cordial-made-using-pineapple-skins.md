I love pineapple but as a food it always seems to have such a tremendous amount of waste. Perhaps this is why tinned pineapple is so popular?



So when I bought a pineapple this week, I decided to use the core and skin to make pineapple cordial. It&#8217;s a light and flavourful drink, without the sweetness of fresh pineapple or pineapple juice. As I don&#8217;t like sweet drinks it worths wonderfully.
