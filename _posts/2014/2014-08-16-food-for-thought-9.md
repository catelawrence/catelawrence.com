It&#8217;s been a fairly quiet week here in Leipzig. Chris is away in the States so I&#8217;ve been spending a bit of time alone with Mr Pablo doing boring things like accounting. I&#8217;m also working on a presentation for a client back in Australia and recipe testing quite a bit. I&#8217;ve been thinking about releasing a small e-book of recipes that I&#8217;ve been teaching and/or developing, preferably in Deutsch and English. 
  
<br /> My German classes starting in the first week of September and will be Monday-Friday, four hours a day. It&#8217;ll be a challenge as I don&#8217;t have a natural affinity for language but I miss the ability to communication with people on more than a superficial level. As someone who&#8217;s worked from home for many years I like spending time in chit chat, at the shops, coffee shop, post office etc. It sounds superficial, but when this I keenly miss this kind of interaction. 
  
<br /> I&#8217;ve also changed the name of my blog. Basically I am trying to put all the things I&#8217;m doing a bit more under one banner to make it easier and it seemed to make sense to rename the blog also. I&#8217;ve also started a Facebook <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/A-Travelling-Cook/257848761092347">page</a> to link everything together.

I&#8217;ve also started up a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/HandwerkundCocktailsLeipzig/">Craft and Cocktails group </a>here in Leipzig. Crafting seems to be popular from people I&#8217;ve spoken to (you can even get fairly involved crafting supplies at department stores) but there&#8217;s no real visible, organised crafting community. There&#8217;s a shop that does knitting classes and various practicing artists studios and plenty of art exhibitions but not things like craft markets and gatherings. In Melbourne I went to a fortnightly craft group and really enjoyed it. Hence my desire to start something here in Leipzig. I think it might take a while to kick off, but I think it could be something great. Our first event was small but fun. 
  
<br /> My other venture is the <a href="https://gregariousmammal.com/apartment-supper-club">Apartment Supper Club</a>. I&#8217;ve always loved shows like <a href="https://www.channel4.com/programmes/come-dine-with-me/4od">Come Dine With Me </a> for a bit of fun and I&#8217;m hoping this kicks off. There are over 30 supper clubs and underground restaurants in Berlin but none in Leipzig, so fingers crossed. It&#8217;s a little hard to work out the marketing but hoping there&#8217;s so interest. I was thinking of making a flyer to put around all the hotels and backpackers? There&#8217;s very little tourist resources here in English (at least from what I have seen) so it might prove appealing. Likewise a flyer for the craft group might be a good idea. 
  
<br /> I&#8217;m off to Berlin on Sunday to hang out with my friend Kate and visit flea markets. Really keen to get some vintage crockery and linens as I sold off 99% of my collection back in Australia.

  I&#8217;m propogating some succulents on the windowsill (we have no balcony).

Working on my patchwork quilt, as you can see I&#8217;ve got a bit to go! It&#8217;s always good to have an excuse to buy fabric isn&#8217;t it? Especially vintage fabric from ebay. 
  
<br /> I guess like many people, I am deeply sad by the death of Robin Williams. Suicide devastates so many lives and leaves irrepairable damage to friends and family. I&#8217;m writing a bit more about this but I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;ll put it on this blog. That said, the one thing I have found wonderful about Robin&#8217;s death is the sheer number of people speaking openly and honestly about mental health, depression and grief. Powerful stuff.
