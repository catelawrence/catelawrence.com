Living in an old Eastern bloc part of Germany, meat still is (like many parts of the world) a staple in everyday diets. Every day I see people walking around chewing on a fat Bratwurst in a roll. Yuck. I&#8217;ve always hated sausages. 



I recently went out to dinner with some vegan friends to a restaurant that of us had been to before, S Kultur in Lindenau.

<br /> <span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">S Kultur is a lovely light and airy restaurant serving a selection of meals with an emphasis on fresh, seasonal produce. The menu is a combination of omni and vegan dishes across starters, salads and main meals. There was also an extensive wine list. 
  
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><br /> <span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">I wasn&#8217;t particularly hungry so I opted for <span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">2 vegetarian chicken skewers <span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">with dates and pine nuts-peanut sauce <span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">8.90€/12.70AUD.


  <span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><a style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;" href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zId8LE96HkQ/U_XMd4SA-bI/AAAAAAAAJPQ/kZ14-8CUj2w/s1600/2014-08-16%2B19.50.33.jpg"><img class=" aligncenter" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zId8LE96HkQ/U_XMd4SA-bI/AAAAAAAAJPQ/kZ14-8CUj2w/s1600/2014-08-16%2B19.50.33.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="400" border="0" /></a>



  It was absolutely delicious. But I say this with a proviso. This was mock meat made from soy. But it looked and tasted like chicken (perhaps slightly drier). 



   



  One of my dining companions ordered sweet potato and chickpea curry with vegetables and vegetarian chicken pieces on rice (16.50€/ 23.60AUD). My apologies for the picture, my phone camera is a bit crap and I was tying to take a quick snap before we tucked in! 



                               <a style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;" href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-EMZSLny5TB4/U_XMd0zp4GI/AAAAAAAAJPU/TXlXbtZbfts/s1600/2014-08-16%2B19.50.24.jpg"><img class=" aligncenter" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-EMZSLny5TB4/U_XMd0zp4GI/AAAAAAAAJPU/TXlXbtZbfts/s1600/2014-08-16%2B19.50.24.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="400" border="0" /></a>


 She was quite perturbed by the mock chicken, having not had meat for several years. The texture was very different to the soy based mock meats in Australia which are most often sourced from South East Asia, South Africa or America. My other friend ordered linguine with tomato and white wine sauce. 


  We had a chat to one of the owners about the food. She was from Holland and explained that the mock meat was shipped in from <a href="https://www.vegetarianbutcher.com/">The Vegetarian Butcher</a> in The Netherlands, a company that makes a range of mock meats including burgers, chicken, raw minced meat and croquettes. <span style="background-color: white; line-height: 15px;">The concept has grown in <span style="background-color: white; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 15px;">two years from 1 concept store in The Hague to more than 1000 Vegetarian Butcher Dealers <span style="background-color: white; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 15px;">across the Netherlands, through independent fruit-vegetable and butcher shops, natural food stores and supermarkets.

  The owner kindly gave us some Dutch Bitterballs to try from the company. They are usually sold retail at S Kultur but they were waiting on a shipment. They had a crispy crust and inside was a creamy mixture based on organic lupin. Severed with a side of mustard they were divine! 



   



  I also enjoyed some delicious wine. Perhaps the only thing missing from the menu was vegan options for desserts. I know some vegan folks wouldn&#8217;t want to eat at a restaurant that sold meat, let alone mock meat, but for a city where veggie options besides stir fries and felafel can be hard to find (and there are almost no completely vegan restaurants)  it&#8217;s great to have the choice. 



   



  S Kultur isn&#8217;t the cheapest place to eat in Leipzig, but the food was delicious and the ambience most relaxing.
