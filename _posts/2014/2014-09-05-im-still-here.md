Hello,
  
just letting you all know that all is well here in Leipzig. I started Deutsche schule on Tuesday (four hours a day) which has been keeping me incredibly busy. I&#8217;ve also been busy with freelance writing for a somewhat dodgy fashion website- basically writing  descriptions for each outfit features. It pays for a beer and skittles as they say.



Well, there&#8217;s plenty happening this weekend in Leipzig including the Vegan Summer Day which is a big vegan celebration tomorrow. I&#8217;ll be there to take pics and stay tuned for an article telling you all about it! I&#8217;m also writing a range of recipes for  VeganMofo2014 and will finally have some time to writing some down and photograph them this weekend. Write soon!
