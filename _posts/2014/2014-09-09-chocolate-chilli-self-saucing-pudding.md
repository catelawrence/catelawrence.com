I love chocolate puddings so I decided to make up a vegan one. It&#8217;s funny when I think that I used to buy these as a packet mix when I was younger, they are so easy to make from scratch!Â 

_<br /> __Ingredients_

1 cup self raising flour

1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder

3/4 cup white sugar

1 teaspoon vanilla powder/essence

2 tablespoon cocoa

70 grams dark chocolate, diced

Handful roast hazlenuts

2 teaspoon dried chilli flakes*

1/2 cup milk

Sauce:

3/4 cup brown sugar

2 tablespoons cocoa powder

2 cups boiling water

30g non dairy spread

<i><br /> </i><i>Instructions</i>

  1. Sift flour, baking powder, sugar and cocoa
  2. Add chocolate, hazelnuts and chilli flakes
  3. Stir in milk slowly and mix until combined
  4. Add to baking dish

Sauce:

  1. Melt spread in water in a saucepan
  2. Add sugar and cocoa powder and stir until sugar is dissolved
  3. Pour sauce over pudding and place in oven.
  4. Bake for 45 minutes
  5. Serve with cream/sorbet/ice cream and fresh fruit if desired.

*Add chilli flakes to taste based on what you&#8217;d normally put in your favourite savoury dish. Or you can leave them out of course!
