  It&#8217;s quite difficult to find &#8216;pickling&#8217; cucumbers in Australia where I lived. They are more of an heirloom speciality product to be found at a higher price at Farmer&#8217;s Markets. I love the look of pickling cucumbers with all the little pimply prints on on the other skin. They taste great and are lovely and crisp, so of course, I simply had to make pickled cucumbers! I used to teach this recipe, it&#8217;s one of my favourites.
