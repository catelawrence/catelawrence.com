I made up this recipe as I wanted to make something with eggplant. This is one of those recipes with a few steps but it would be a great way to use up any leftover roast veggies and quinoa. I originally intended on adding walnuts to the recipe, but I&#8217;ve not found a cheap source of nuts in Leipzig yet. In Australia I used to buy mine at a wholesalers in bulk but they don&#8217;t seem to be so easy to find. I had an opened packet of quinoa so I decided to use that instead to add bulk and crunch when baked. They are really tasty and work really well with a yogurt based or chilli dip.



_Ingredients_

  * 2 large eggplants, diced
  * 1 onion, diced
  * 2 garlic cloves, diced
  * 1 cup quinoa
  * 1 cup black fungi (available dehydrated at Asian grocers) or you could of course use button mushrooms
  * 1 cup breadcrumbs
  * 1/2 tablespoon dried basil, parsley and/or herbs of choice
  * Salt and pepper to taste

_Instructions_

  * Soak black fungi in hot water until expanded and soft. Finely dice either by hand or with a food processor
  * Place quinoa in a saucepan with 3 cups of water. Cook until water has evaporated and quinoa is soft (add more water if needed)
  * Place eggplant in the oven with a good shake of olive oil and bake until soft
  * Fry garlic and onions
  * Place eggplant in food processor and blitz until combined. It doesn&#8217;t have to be perfectly smooth.
  * Place garlic, onions, bread crumbs, eggplant, cooled quinoa, fungi, herbs and salt and pepper in a bowl.
  * Mix well and shape into small balls.
  * Spray very lightly with olive oil and place on a lined baking tray
  * Bake for 30-40mins at 200c until baked, turning once to ensure they are evenly cooked.
  * Serve with mustard or dips of choice.
