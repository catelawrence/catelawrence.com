We used to run a popular workshop at Green Renters on cordials and ginger beer where I would demonstrate some of my favourite recipes. This was a recipe I read about in a historical book and adapted somewhat to suit a workshop audience. It works wonderfully as a cool, refreshing drinking or when added to sparkling water and gin or vodka, for a cocktail with a difference. Use red roses if you can, the colour looks gorgeous.



**Rose cordial**

_Ingredients_

  * 3 cups of red/pink rose petals*
  * 1 cup water
  * 2 cups sugar
  * Juice of 1 lemon





  <i>Instructions</i>


  1. <div style="clear: both; display: inline !important; text-align: center;">
      Carefully wash petals and add to a small saucepan with 1 cup water and 2 cup sugar.
    

  2. Bring to boil stirring gently to ensure the sugar dissolves.
  3. Reduce to simmer for 10 minutes.
  4. Leave to steep for 20 minutes until cool.
  5. Strain through a fine sieve and pour in clean, sterilised bottles or jars.


  *Obviously the roses should be from your own or a friend&#8217;s garden and grown without any kind of pesticides.
