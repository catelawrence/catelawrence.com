  I have a bag of lemons that I bought last week in preparation for cold and flu season. We&#8217;ve had our first snow so it&#8217;s now time to put them to good use. This cordial is a great tonic for winter, the barley makes it refreshing and moreish. I don&#8217;t like my drinks too sweet so  I keep the sugar content low. You could certainly add more to taste.
