Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I love living in Deutschland. It&#8217;s been six months now, 6 wonderful months but also six months of strangeness and challenges that extend beyond the obvious language barrier. Inspired by <i><a href="https://ohgodmywifeisgerman.com/2014/12/15/tips-from-an-american-expat-everyday-products-youll-miss-after-moving-to-germany/">Oh God my wife is German</a></i>, I&#8217;ve been thinking about things in Australia I really miss.
  
<br /> I miss: 
  
**<br /> ****Decent pillows.**<br /> I&#8217;m talking pillows that are firm not floppy. Spongy rather than feathery. Where your head sinks <i>on </i>the pillow, not <i>in</i> the pillow. German pillows are traditionally the square &#8216;European&#8217; Pillow variety. I had some in Australia from Target,  but they were firm not floppy! In case you&#8217;re thinking, oh you&#8217;re just stingy, surely you can pay a bit more for a decent one? Well we&#8217;ve looked, you can get higher quality pillows at a higher price, but they are still floppy dammit! You spent a lot of time asleep so a decent pillow is so very important. 
  
<br /> **Top sheets.**

  It&#8217;s just a bit of fabric, but I really miss having a top sheet. I know duvets, doonas and comforters are all the range but it&#8217;s great for when it&#8217;s too hot for a doona or a bit cold without. I like layers on my bed and this is a layer. 



   



  <b>Queen size beds. </b>

  Here, we sleep together in a double bed. Most people who own queen size beds have two single beds pushed together with two single doonas on top. Nope. Not the same as a real queen size bed. To get even close to the size of a queen size bed that I am used to, I would need to buy a king size bed. You can see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bed_size">bed size comparisions on this chart</a>. I can see the merits of the single doonas though. No one hogs the doona then. 



   



  <b>Dumplings.</b>

  <span style="background-color: white; line-height: 20.7900009155273px;">I&#8217;ve been seriously craving Asian dumplings since I left Melbourne. I really miss <a style="background-color: white; line-height: 20.7900009155273px; text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.broadsheet.com.au/melbourne/food-and-drink/directory/restaurant/shandong-mama">ShanDon Mama </a><span style="background-color: white; line-height: 20.7900009155273px;">and  of course <a style="background-color: white; line-height: 20.7900009155273px; text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.urbanspoon.com/r/71/760392/restaurant/CBD/Camy-Shanghai-Dumpling-Melbourne">Camy Shanghai Dumpling House</a><span style="background-color: white; line-height: 20.7900009155273px;">! There&#8217;s a couple of places where I can buy frozen ones here in Leipzig and of course I make my own dumplings and <a style="background-color: white; line-height: 20.7900009155273px; text-decoration: none;" href="https://atravellingcook.com/2014/07/pierogies.html">pierogies </a><span style="background-color: white; line-height: 20.7900009155273px;">but it&#8217;s not the same as a huge bamboo basket of steaming dumplings served with chilli oil, soy sauce and vinegar and a plate of garlic Chinese broccoli! (Eat them fast while the rest are coming and drink your weight in Jasmine tea).  South east asian food here generally is sold from a restaurant which sells a mishmash of Chinese,Vietnamese, Thai, Indian and pizza, most of which contains pork. There&#8217;s one Vietnamese place we really like but it doesn&#8217;t do dumplings, probably a good thing. 



  <span style="background-color: white; line-height: 20.7900009155273px;"> 



  <span style="background-color: white; line-height: 20.7900009155273px;"><b>Plentiful medical supplies without prescription.</b>



  <span style="background-color: white; line-height: 20.7900009155273px;">I am a huge fan of pharmaceuticals, they have kept me alive many times. I get migraines and I like to have a plentiful supply of codeine, asprin and muscle relaxants which enable me to treat a migraine straight away and thus prevent a three day headache. I used to buy such treatments at the supermarket and chemist (over the counter) in Australia. In Deutschland you can&#8217;t even buy paracetamol at the supermarket. And i am constantly confused by all the homeopathic treatments, considering they are derided in much of the developed world as little more than placebos without scientific merit. 



  <span style="background-color: white; line-height: 20.7900009155273px;"> 



  <span style="background-color: white; line-height: 20.7900009155273px;"><b>Cheap nuts, dried fruit and spices</b>



  <span style="background-color: white; line-height: 20.7900009155273px;">So expensive here, besides the spice lady i buy my spices from at the outdoor market. I really don&#8217;t know why. Apparently this is the case for much of Europe. 



  <span style="background-color: white; line-height: 20.7900009155273px;"> 



  <span style="background-color: white; line-height: 20.7900009155273px;"><b>Blocks of Cheddar cheese</b>



  <span style="background-color: white; line-height: 20.7900009155273px;">Cheese here is generally quite mild. I like a nice big block of vintage tasty. Not so easy to find.
