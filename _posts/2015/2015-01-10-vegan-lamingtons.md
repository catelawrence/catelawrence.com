I&#8217;ve always loved Lamingtons, so I decided to have a go at a vegan version. For those unfamiliar with this particular Australian delicacy, it is basically baked sponge cake which is dipped in chocolate icing and rolled in coconut. To go all out, the sponge cake can be sandwiched with cream and jam before icing. I can&#8217;t for the life of me remember where I got the original sponge recipe which inspired my version as it had been sitting as a word document for three years in my drop box. A lot of vegan cake baking includes bicarbonate soda or baking soda in the dry ingredients but I avoid it as a rule as I&#8217;ve tasted quite a few vegan cakes with a nasty bicarb after taste. It&#8217;s also been my experience with the use of vinegar. If you want to make your life easier, the sponge can be made beforehand and stored in the freezer until ready to use.



_Ingredients_


Sponge:<br style="mso-special-character: line-break;" /><!--[endif]-->





  * 2 1/2 cups plain flour
  * 1 1/4 cup sugar
  * 1 1/2 cup nut milk
  * ⅓ cup of soda water
  * ¼ cup vegetable oil (non hydrogenated)
  * 1 tbsp lemon juice
  * 2 tsp baking powder
  * 1 tbs of arrowroot cornflour
  * 1 tbs of vanilla essence


  Chocolate icing:





  * 1 cup sugar
  * 1/3 cup cocoa powder
  * 1 teaspoon cinnamon
  * 1 teaspoon vanilla essence
  * 1 cup boiling water
  * Dessicated coconut

_Instructions_


Sponge:





  1. Pre-heat oven to 180 celcius
  2. Whisk the lemon and milk together and leave aside for 5 minutes to curdle.
  3. Mix together the dry ingredients (flour, sugar, baking powder, cornflour,)
  4. Add the oil, milk and vanilla essence to the wet mixture
  5. Once there are no lumps, add the soda water and stir well
  6. Put the mixture into one large rectangular cake tin
  7. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until a skewer comes out clean
  8. Cool on a rack under completely cool (too warm and the cake will sink in the lamington chocolate)


  <i>Icing:</i>



  Combine all ingredients and stir well until sugar is dissolved. If you like a thicker icing, use less water.






  To assemble:



  <ol>
    <li>
      Place icing next to a shallow dish or plate of dessicated coconut.
    </li>
    <li>
      Working quickly, dip cake quickly in the icing then roll gently in coconut.
