  After Christmas Chris and I went to the UK for a week to visit friends and relatives. We took a trip to my favourite market, <a href="https://boroughmarket.org.uk/">Borough Market </a>in Southwark, London. As you can see it was a cold, drizzly day and going anywhere with a cover overtop was welcome! Borough market has lots of stalls selling a variety of food products such as <span style="background-color: white; color: #545454; line-height: 18.2000007629395px;"> bread, fruit and vegetables, delicatessan, <span style="background-color: white; line-height: 18.2000007629395px;">vegetables, ciders, cheeses and tea. We have a lovely morning sampling the wares (so much good cheese after Germany&#8217;s bland offerings).

  I loved watching this woman making enormous sandwiches at the Spanish delicatessan.

  I would have bought a heap of preserves if not for the &#8216;no liquids in carry on baggage on plane&#8217; rule.

So much cheese!

I had one of these olive and cheese sticks. So good!

  This stall of Middle Eastern goodness made me think of the yummy foods we used to enjoy in Brunswick and Coburg.  Most of the stalls were of proudly British produce but there was also quite a bit from France, Spain, Greece and a little from the Middle East.





And yes, we sampled wine and cider.


  It&#8217;s definitely worth a visit if you&#8217;re in the area. Lot&#8217;s of lovely fresh produce and you could easily make the most amazing hamper for a picnic or a hotel room snack dinner.

  We enjoyed orange and zucchini cake and coffee from a gelato bar just around the corner (crowd free) 



   



  We stayed at <a href="https://www.lsevacations.co.uk/Home.aspx#sthash.4ey8JCpu.dpbs">London School of Economics student accomodation</a> (Rosebery Hall) for two nights which they make available to the public over the semester breaks. It was a good location for where we wanted to go and places we were visiting. We had a perfectly fine room, warm and quiet with a shared bathroom and kitchen down the hall. It was less than staying in a room in someone&#8217;s apartment through AirBnb and definitely cheaper than a hotel.
