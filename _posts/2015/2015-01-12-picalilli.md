  Piccalilli is an interesting beast. It&#8217;s an English relish which originates from trading times when the English travelled by sea to buy spices from India. Tumeric and mustard powder give it it&#8217;s lovely yellow colour and it&#8217;s worth noting from years of teaching preserving that tumeric stains light coloured countertops very easily so pop down a cutting board or some paper to save yourself any bother. You can use apple cider vinegar as an alternative to malt vinegar (or even just plain white vinegar). I used balsamic vinegar in my latest batch for a twist so it&#8217;s brown rather than this lovely shade of yellow. Leave the relish as long as you can before eating (up to three months if it has been waterbathed and stored appropriately) for the flavours to meld. Even a week helps!
