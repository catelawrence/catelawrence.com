I&#8217;ve been getting into soups a lot for lunch this winter. Basically I cook up a a big batch and freeze it in smaller zip lock bags and tubs for lunch, served with bread and spread ( &#8216;butter&#8217; or avocado). Feel free to vary the ingredients and spices, it&#8217;s a tasty soup which lends itself to big flavours or something milder.



_Ingredients_

  * Olive oil
  * 1 onion, diced
  * 3 cloves garlic, diced
  * 1 long green chilli, diced
  * 3 carrots, diced
  * 1 zucchini
  * 1 cup lentils
  * 2 teaspoons miso paste
  * 1 1/2 litres vegetable stock
  * 1 kilo broccoli
  * big handful of rocket

_Directions_:

  1. Brown onion, garlic, chilli and zucchini.
  2. Add miso paste, half of the stock and lentil and cook until lentils and carrots are tender
  3. Add broccoli, rocket and other half of the stock.
  4. Cook until broccoli is tender (probably 5 minutes or so).
  5. Blend with a stick blender.
  6. Adjust seasoning to taste.


  Serve with a squeeze of lemon juice or topped <span style="text-align: center;">with soy sour cream or cashew cream and parsley.
