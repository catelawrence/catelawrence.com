January is always a bit of a nothing month in some respects. But I must confess to loving the cooler weather, it makes it better for sleeping, that&#8217;s for sure! I have [Timehop](https://timehop.com/) on my phone and I look back at the hot weather with dread this time in previous years.

Sadly our sweet Mr Pablo was put to sleep last Friday. He had been unwell for some time with old age and was starting to suffer. We went to a wonderful vet clinic here who assessed him and concluded that the end was near. He wasn&#8217;t eating or drinking so we made the decision together to put him to sleep. He had a wonderful 18 years, four is which he shared with us. We both miss him terribly. I keep expecting to see his little face peeking around the corner of the apartment or hear his meow. When we get settled somewhere permanently, we&#8217;ll certainly get another kitty but not for a while yet.

I released my first ebook this week, _[Australian Classics Veganised](https://sellfy.com/p/2sEt/)_. It&#8217;s a small recipe book of 11 recipes. I initially planned to do a blog post consolidating a series of Australian vegan friendly recipes from different bloggers but I did not get many entries. So I decided to put that project on hold and work on my first recipe book. Keeping busy is a good way to work through grief. Writing recipes is more work than it looks, I know this from teaching recipes! Hopefully people will buy a few copies, I&#8217;d love to spend the money on some new glasses. I&#8217;m also donating 50 cents from each copy to the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre in Melbourne, Australia. I&#8217;m also doing a little guide to ingredients included in in the book on the blog here. It was originally intended for the book but the formatting of the publishing program posted each ingredient on a separate page, annoying.

You might have seen Leipzig in the news regard the [Lediga and Anti-Lediga protests](https://www.thelocal.de/20150113/100000-march-against-pegida)? Its interesting to observe as an expat. We went along to the first big protest against Lediga Monday last week with over 30,000 Leipzigers. Those numbers are amazing considering that Leipzig only has 550,000 people. The Lediga people (including many from outside Leipzig that are bused in) pledge to protest each week. There has been bomb threats and assault upon police and journalists. I actually wonder what their final aim is?

Thing that interest me this week:
  
<br /> [The science behind your sriracha obsession](https://www.refinery29.com/sriracha-flavor?utm_source=food52&utm_medium=syndication), Sarah Jacoby, _Refiney 29._ Yes I love the stuff.

[This](https://mynameisyeh.com/mynameisyeh/2015/1/mac-cheese-party) is such a cute idea for a party.

[How to cook the perfect Vegetarian Haggis](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2015/jan/22/how-to-cook-perfect-vegetarian-haggis), Felicity Cloake, _The Guardian._ I had Haggis for the first time last year when i went to a Burns day party.

[We need to remember Anita Cobby](https://www.dailylife.com.au/all-about-women/we-need-to-remember-anita-cobby-20150119-12tb9f.html), Clementine Ford, _Daily Life_. I read a book about her life and death in high school and it&#8217;s haunted me ever since.

I&#8217;ve read a couple of new Chick lit books this week (as&#8230; ahem&#8230; research). I was especially disappointed with Sophie Kinsella&#8217;s latest, _Shopaholic to the Stars_. Painfully littered with American stereotypes (in the worst way), it lacked the wit and humour of some of her other works. _Saving Grace_ was interesting in that the story was superficially compelling but really had so many red herrings that were never developed and a &#8216;baddie&#8217; that never got their comeuppance. Of course, my mood over the last week has not been all that cheerful with Mr Pablo&#8217;s death so it possible I would find any books inadequate.

I&#8217;ve been watching [Gilmore Girls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilmore_Girls) on Netflix and Season Two of [Broadchurch](https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2014/dec/29/broadchurch-returns-series-two-will-you-be-watching).

Lots of bits and pieces to be getting on with, write again soon&#8230;
