Despite appearances to the contrary, I don&#8217;t eat fried food and sweet stuff all the time! My favourite food is actually soup which I love to cook (and eat) and I like making up recipes using what I have on hand. Ever since teaching preserving workshops, I&#8217;m a big fan of pickled vegetables. They are incredibly easy to make and great for gut health.



I&#8217;m a keen pickler. I love making kim chi, [picalilli](https://atravellingcook.com/2015/01/picalilli.html),  [pickled beetroot](https://atravellingcook.com/2014/08/pickled-beetroots-and-beetroot-bread.html) and [pickled cucumbers](https://atravellingcook.com/2014/09/spicy-pickled-cucumbers.html) amongst other recipes. They go wonderfully with so many different snacks and meals and can also be enjoyed by the jar, standing in front of the fridge with a fork.

I can&#8217;t eat a lot of wheat so I&#8217;m always on the look out for tasty grains. I finally found pearl barley at the supermarket here in Leipzig so I decided to knocked up a simple salad. Grains can be cooked in bulk and frozen in zip lock bags for easy meals, just add some veggies and seasoning and the food is on the table before you know it!

This is a salad where you can add veggies you like and omit those you don&#8217;t. I would have used fresh parsley but was unable to find any in the supermarket so dried had to do. The dressing is light and can be flavoured with herbs or chilli if you like.
