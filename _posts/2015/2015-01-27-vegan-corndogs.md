I made corn dogs last year for our vegan Oktoberfest supper club event and they were definitely a hit. They are incredibly easy to make and very quick. For a crowd it's best to have the oven preheated so you can keep the cooked ones warm until the others are done.

_Ingredients_

-   1 1/4 cup plain flour
-   1 cup yellow cornmeal (not corn flour)
-   1 tbs sugar
-   1 tsp salt
-   1/2 teaspoon garlic and onion powder
-   1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
-   1 1/2 cups dairy free milk
-   Vegan hot dogs/sausages
-   Plant oil for frying
-   skewers

_Instructions_

1.  Preheat the oven to 150 celcius and put in a tray lined with foil.
2.  Before you start frying: Check the sizing of your corn dogs. I only have a few saucepans here and a full size frankfurt with a skewer stuck in it won't lie in the biggest pot so I cut the frankfurts and my skewers in half and made smaller corn dogs.
3.  Heat plant oil in large heavy based saucepan.
4.  Put 1/4 cup of plain flour on a plate.
5.  Combine the remaining ingredients together in a bowl and stir well. You want the batter to have the consistency of pancake batter.
6.  Pour into a tall glass or jug for ease of dipping
7.  Pat the hot dogs dry with a paper towel.
8.  Put one stick into each corn dog.
9.  Roll the frankfurts in the corn flour and shake off the excess.
10. Dip each corn dog into the batter and twirl it around as you remove it from the glass.
11. Immediately put it into the boiling oil and fry until browned
12. Place on kitchen paper to drain then pop in the oven until all corndogs are done
13. Serve with tomato sauce, barbecue sauce, sriracha and mustard.

Tofu hot dogs are really good.
