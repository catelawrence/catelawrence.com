    I&#8217;ve been meaning to make one of these loaves for a while. It&#8217;s a really simple recipe which goes great with soup or salad or as part of a party night hors d&#8217;oeuvre. It&#8217;s great for sharing with friends who don&#8217;t mind eating with their fingers and is totally moreish!


  
    Take some time cutting your loaf, I find it best to take it slow and it&#8217;s pretty easy. The trick is to cut the loaf deep (close to the bottom without cutting the bottom of your loaf of bread) as the deeper the cuts, the more fillings you can put in and the better it will taste. I put vegan chorizo in my loaf as I couldn&#8217;t find any vegan bacon which I prefer. It was still delicious and eaten over two meals rather quickly!


  
    I&#8217;ll be adding this as a free recipe for my next ebook. (The <a href="https://atravellingcook.com/2015/01/my-new-recipe-ebook-australian-classics-veganised.html">first is</a> <a href="https://sellfy.com/p/2sEt/">still available</a> for only $3 with 50c going to the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre in Melbourne Australia). <br /> <br />                                    <a style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;" href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-nrYwjIdqp20/VNSpSTc7v2I/AAAAAAAAKmc/xTPpHhdR-Kk/s1600/2015-02-02%2B22.56.31.jpg"><img src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-nrYwjIdqp20/VNSpSTc7v2I/AAAAAAAAKmc/xTPpHhdR-Kk/s1600/2015-02-02%2B22.56.31.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="270" border="0" /></a>





_Ingredients_


  <ul>
    <li>
      1 rounded loaf of bread
    </li>
    <li>
      Vegan butter or olive oil
    </li>
    <li>
      Choice of fillings e.g: dairy free cheese, spring onions or <a href="https://atravellingcook.com/2014/02/edible-gifts-onion-jam.html">onion jam</a>, finely diced garlic, diced animal free chorizo or bacon, diced olives
    </li>
    <li>
      Dried herbs
    </li>
    <li>
      Salt and pepper to taste
    </li>
  </ul>



  <em>Instructions:</em>


  * Preheat the oven to 180 degrees celcius (350 degrees fahrenheit).
  * Slice the bread into cubes: Slice the bread horizontally and vertically into 1-inch cubes. Do not slice all the way through the loaf — leave bottom of the loaf intact with the bread pieces still attached.
  * Fry garlic and onions/spring onions and faux bacon/chorizo in a pan for about 5 minutes until mostly cooked. 
  * Combine with any desired toppings in a bowl and mix well
  * Stuff the cheese and toppings into the bread between the slices. It is easiest to stuff one way and then another as less falls out that way! You can also put little slivers of butter in the slices for extra oozy goodness.
  * Pour melted butter  (or brush a little olive oil over top)
  * Wrap loaf in foil and bake for 20 minutes then unwrap the loaf and bake for another 10 minutes until the cheese is totally melted and the top of the loaf is crispy. 
  *  Serve the loaf while still hot from the oven.
