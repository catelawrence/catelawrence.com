  Every so often food trends come and go from sun-dried tomatoes to focaccias to cupcakes and cronuts. Heck I&#8217;ve even been guilty of falling prey to the donut trend, making my own rather tasty <a href="https://atravellingcook.com/2014/07/vegan-oven-baked-donuts.html">vegan baked donuts</a>. As I write recipes and read food blogs, sometimes I see the same recipes again and again. They are usually exclaimed over as though no one else has over made them quite so good, but only the next day you&#8217;ll see another recipe pop up for raspberry and chia jam or mango and chia seed pudding.











  I know that food trends, especially in vegan cooking, come from a desire to abstain from particular ingredients or an inability to eat certain food due to severe allergies. It&#8217;s great that people take the time to be inventive and create new food combinations. I don&#8217;t have to like all of them. Heck, I love quinoa and I&#8217;m not ashamed to admit it. I even made a <a href="https://atravellingcook.com/2015/01/gluten-free-cauliflower-pizza-base.html">cauliflower pizza base</a>! But it&#8217;s when I see them so many times that I start thinking that I wish they&#8217;d disappear&#8230;.


**Massaged kale**

Rubbing a bit of brassica (part of the cabbage family) in coconut oil until it until it resembles salad that&#8217;s been sitting in the bottom of the salad bowl marinading in italian salad dressing at a family barbecue in the sun for the better part of a day? Yuck. Where I live you can&#8217;t actually buy kale except for one week a year.

**Kale chips**

<span style="font-size: x-small;"><br /> <span style="font-size: x-small;"><br /> Sorry, they&#8217;re just not the same as potato chips. Or even as good as beetroot chips. There&#8217;s something about them that catches in the back of my throat, combined with the smell of nutritional yeast that, as much as I love the stuff, reminds me of vitamin B tablets.

**Chia pudding**

<span style="font-size: x-small;"><br /> Yes, it&#8217;s healthy and an alternative to creamy, high fat desserts. But after they&#8217;ve been soaking a while, chia seeds resemble frogs eggs turning into tadpoles, all slimy. Did you ever study those at school? I did. It was a little bit creepy.

And don&#8217;t get me started on chia jam, whilst it has it&#8217;s place, in my humble opinion it&#8217;s not as good as my [pear and vanilla](https://atravellingcook.com/2014/12/pear-and-vanilla-bean-jam.html) or [strawberry and rosewater jam](https://atravellingcook.com/2014/07/strawberry-fields-forever-strawberry-and-rosewater-jam-strawberry-cordial.html). Just saying.




**Brussel sprouts**

  <span style="font-size: x-small;"> 


Brussel sprouts are very popular in Germany and as cheap as carrots and cabbages. But if I see another recipe for brussel sprouts fried or baked with oil, garlic and salt and pepper (with or without nuts and bacon). Surely everyone has worked these out by now that these go best fried rather than boiled within an inch of their lives like in years gone by?

**Green juice smoothies**

  <span style="font-size: x-small;"> 


Yes, I know, you have an amazing blender (the maker of which sponsors your blog posts according to your disclaimer). And I have no longer got a blender since I moved house so I am poorer than you and cannot make smoothies or juices anymore. But do you have to make another post every time you replace spinach with kale or blueberries with raspberries? Here in Germany you can buy cabbage juice at the supermarket by the carton. That&#8217;s hardcore.

**Two ingredient ice cream**

<span style="font-size: x-small;"><br /> You&#8217;ve discovered this amazing way to make ice cream, so much so that you went and bought an ice cream maker. And you&#8217;re going to share it with all of us. If I read a little further I will invariably discover that your magic ingredient is either bananas or coconut milk. Sometimes you even go crazy and use both! I have made ice cream both ways and it invariably taste like either bananas soft serve or coconut soft serve. Not surprising really.

**6 Food trends I am eagerly awaiting**

**Poutine**


  <a  href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-kriej0yVsJ8/VN-d0ESd8YI/AAAAAAAAKq0/IiO97j-bUMw/s1600/702px-Poutine.JPG"><img src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-kriej0yVsJ8/VN-d0ESd8YI/AAAAAAAAKq0/IiO97j-bUMw/s1600/702px-Poutine.JPG" alt="" width="320" height="273" border="0" /></a>

** Hot chips with cheese curds and gravy. How could it be wrong? I tried it first in Montreal at the Jazz Festival, then was a regular at Melbourne&#8217;s [Lord of the Fries.](https://www.lordofthefries.com.au/) So good.

**Linner**
  
Like brunch but later and far boozier.

**Sunday roasts in restaurants for lunch**
  
Roast meat/nuts/tofu, roast veg, greens and gravy. A staple at British pubs and occasionally in Australia. Not so much in Germany unless you want the ubiquitous pork and potatoes that you can also get any other day, any time.

**More smaller serve recipes**
  
Single unit dwellings are a thing. Many of us are couple or not but happily child free. We can end up eating that same dish three days in a row. Not everyone has much freezer space. That said, I&#8217;ve seen recipes for a single chocolate chip cookie, these make me sad.

**More local fruits and vegetables**
  
Since moved to Germany I&#8217;ve fallen in love with [kohlrabi](https://atravellingcook.com/2014/08/kohlrabi-coleslaw.html) and Schwarzwurzel (salsify). Back in Australia I loved bok choy, choy sum and chinese broccoli, (not so accessible except in asian grocers here) not to mention Lychees and Dragonfruit from Queensland. It&#8217;s fun to try things you haven&#8217;t had the opportunity to eat much of, or in turn cook your favourites in a new ways using local ingredients.

**More supperclubs and potlucks. **
  
I&#8217;ve loved running a supper club for the last 6 months. I love the way that food can bring people together, especially those who might otherwise be socially isolated or lacking the opportunity to meet new people. People have been creating websites and apps to bring people together all around the world, but what is needed most is for people to open their homes and give it a go. It&#8217;s fun and a great way to move out of our comfort zone and challenge yourself.
