I&#8217;ve been busy with house hunting so I am rather behind in finishing this post. I got some very good news yesterday, we&#8217;ve been accepted for a rental property in Prenzlauer berg in Berlin! Such a relief as we were starting to worry a bit. Here&#8217;s a few things I&#8217;ve been watching, reading and thinking about:



This is pretty much my dream office!



[Overnight, everything I loved was gone: the internet shaming of Lindsay Stone,](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/21/internet-shaming-lindsey-stone-jon-ronson?CMP=soc_567) Jon Ronson, _The Guardian_. I realise this is an except of a book, but I find it very interesting.

[What nobody told me about small farming: I can&#8217;t make a living](https://www.salon.com/2015/02/10/what_nobody_told_me_about_small_farming_i_cant_make_a_living/), Jaclyn Moyer, _Salon. _

[Why are white people expats when the rest of us are immigrants?](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/mar/13/white-people-expats-immigrants-migration),Mawuna Remarque Koutonin, _The Guardian._ I often wonder this.

[How Tim Gunn of Project Runway spends his Sunday,](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/nyregion/how-tim-gunn-of-project-runway-spends-his-sunday.html?&_r=0) Kaya Mayer Robinson, _The International New York Times_. I&#8217;m a big Project Runway fan and I love the grace of Tim Gunn.

[This man wants people to stop serving food on wooden boards](https://munchies.vice.com/articles/this-man-wants-people-to-stop-serving-food-on-wooden-boards), Phoebe Hurst, _Munchies._ I especially hate slate tiles, they look terribly heavy and uncomfortable to carry.

[Koreans have an insatiable appetite for watching strangers binge eat](https://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2015/03/24/392430233/koreans-have-an-insatiable-appetite-for-watching-strangers-binge-eat?utm_source=facebook.com&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=npr&utm_term=nprnews&utm_content=20150324), Elise Hu, _The Salt_.  Looks more like eating disorders to me!

[Wake up bloggerverse, it&#8217;s time for change](https://www.millicentnankivell.com/03/wake-up-bloggerverse-time-for-change/), _Millicent Nankivell._ A thoughtful piece about the state of blogging and authenticity. A lot of us have been thinking about it ( I wrote about it [here](https://atravellingcook.com/2015/03/the-integrity-of-blogging-in-the-time-of-the-super-blogger.html)) and it&#8217;s great to see the extent of the conversation.
