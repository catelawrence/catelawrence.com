I&#8217;ve never been a big fan of the term &#8216;cookies&#8217;. I&#8217;m Australia so I always think &#8216;they&#8217;re not cookies, they&#8217;re biscuits!&#8217;  But I&#8217;ve been eating cornflakes for breakfast most mornings and I wanted to cook something sweet with them. Cornflake cookies sounds better than Cornflake biscuits in how it rolls of the tongue, so I have named them thus. I&#8217;m the first to admit that they aren&#8217;t the most attractive cookie in the world but they are incredibly moreish! 

_Ingredients_

  * 1/3 cup softened dairy free butter
  * 1/3 cup sugar
  * 1 teaspoon vanilla essence
  * 1 teaspoon powdered ginger
  * 1 teaspoon powdered cinnamon
  * 1 cup flour
  * 1/2  teaspoon baking powder
  * 1 and a 1/2 cups cornflakes
  * 1/2 cup slivered almonds
  * 1/2 cup sultanas
  * 1/2 cup water (or more if needed)

_Instructions_

  1. Preheat oven to 200c (400f)
  2. Cream butter and sugar together in a bowl until well combined.
  
    Add vanilla and spices and mix well.
  3. Add flour, baking powder, almond and sultantas and half the cornflakes. Stir until well combined adding water as needed (about half a cup) until the mix creates a dough.
  
    Gently need and refrigerate for 20 minutes.
  4. Remove from the fridge and add the rest of the cornflakes, mixing them into the dough with your hands.
  5. Form into small balls (you&#8217;ll get about 20) and place on a baking tray lined with baking paper.
  6. Bake in the in the middle rack of the oven. Cookies are done when they start to get lightly golden, and when you can smell them. This should take about 15-20 minutes, but cooking time will vary depending on the oven.
  7. Once cooked, removed cooking from the oven and cool. They will be soft when they come out of the oven but become more crunchy once they have cooled.
