  1. I&#8217;m left handed. I blame this for my inability to crochet, write neatly on whiteboards and blackboards, use a can opener and cut out material with sewing scissors.
  2. Every morning I start the day with a mug of earl grey tea. During the week my husband brings it to me. On the weekends I&#8217;m on tea and coffee making duty.

  3. As a child I had a fear of men with beards. There&#8217;s several photos of me sitting on Santa&#8217;s lap at some shopping centre weeping terrified tears. I&#8217;m not overly fond of them still.
  4. I always thought hangovers would be less vicious as I aged. It&#8217;s sadly untrue.
  5. I am chronically untidy. This also does not improve with age but a nagging husband helps me keep it in check.
  6. I have had two operations (well two on each leg) on my legs in the last year. I still have trouble walking but the pain is much less.
  7. My favourite flowers are blue hydrangeas.

  8. I have no idea how to drive. But I can ride a bike.
  9. I&#8217;m not a morning person but I&#8217;m not much good at night either. Hmmm&#8230;
 10. i am a terrible procrastinator. I&#8217;ve been working on this patchwork quilt for about three years. Maybe this will be the year to finish it?

 11. One of my strangest jobs was working with people with hoarding problems (cleaning not therapy).
 12. I always work best with background noise: podcasts, tv shows, music, radio plays&#8230;
 13. Quiet libraries are my happy place. A library with a bar would be heaven.
 14. The worst thing about writing a novel is the fear that no one will read it.
 15. I miss having a clothesline, I liked seeing the washing blowing in the breeze.
 16. I used to hit people in my sleep. Gave one partner a black eye. I have no recollection of doing this.
 17. I find all sports mind numbingly boring.
 18. I hate peanuts, kale, coriander and beer.
 19. My favourite instrument is the harpsichord.
 20. Living in Germany I really miss Vegemite. Must make a trip to the Australia shop.
