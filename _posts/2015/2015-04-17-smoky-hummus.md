My husband loves hummus, hommous, hummous or chickpea dip depending on your spelling, so I decided to whip up a quick batch. I used cooked chickpeas rather than tinned which means they take longer to blend if you haven&#8217;t cooked them until they&#8217;re super soft.



It&#8217;s a lovely recipe which is great with cut up veggies, bread, on sandwiches, with [dukkah](https://atravellingcook.com/2014/03/sunday-cooking-dukkah.html "Dukkah") and as a condiment to a middle eastern meal. I tend to make my recipe a little different to others, but i like it! You can omit the sunflower seeds, but I find they lend a lovely creamy texture to the dip.

_Ingredients:_

  * 2 cups cooked and cooled chickpeas
  * 1/2 cup sunflower seeds, soaked in hot water for 1 hour then drained
  * 2 cloves garlic, minced
  * 1 1/2 teaspoons salt
  * Lemon juice from 1 freshly squeezed lemon
  * 1/2 cup water
  * 1/3 cup tahini, stirred well
  * 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
  * Liquid smoke, to taste

_Instructions_

  1. Add all ingredients except liquid smoke to a blender and blend until combined. I tend to keep mine a little chunky. You can also use an immersion blender.
  2. Add more water if you prefer a smoother dip.
  3. Add a drop of liquid smoke, stir well then add more to taste (go slow, this stuff is potent!).
