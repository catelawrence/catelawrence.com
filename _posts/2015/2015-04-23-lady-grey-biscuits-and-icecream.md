I used to make tea loaf back in Australia, a rich fruity loaf which was full of fruit and nuts that had been soaked in tea. I&#8217;ve always enjoyed making tea biscuits also, especially with Earl grey tea, my favourite. Earl grey tea has a rather [strange history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl_Grey_tea), although it is hard to determine definite facts! I also am fond of Lady grey tea and as I had an orange going spare I put these two recipes together.



Coconut milk ice cream recipes are nothing new, I&#8217;ve made them several times. I&#8217;ve never owned an ice cream maker and in my experience your ice cream will always be a little icier than desirable without one. I found this works in my advantage actually, as I can&#8217;t eat too much at once! It&#8217;s deliciously flavoursome, although the colour isn&#8217;t the prettiest due to being the colouring of tea! I&#8217;d encourage you to give it a try.

_Ingredients_

  * 2 cups plain flour
  * 6 earl grey teabags or three tablespoons of loose leaf tea
  * 2/3 cup sugar
  * 1/2 tspn salt
  * zest of 1/2 orange
  * 125g butter
  * 1 tspn vanilla
  * Juice of 1/2 orange
  * 1/2 cup water

Instructions

  1. Preheat oven to 190c (375f).
  2. Line 2 baking trays with baking paper.
  3. Sift flour into a bowl.
  4. Add salt.
  5. Cut open teabags and add tea leaves. Stir well.
  6. Add orange zest and butter.
  7. Rub butter and zest through with your fingers until mixture is crumbly.
  8. Add vanilla, juice and water (as needed) bring the dough together into a dough.
  9. Knead lightly for a couple of minutes and shape into a log shape.
 10. Roll in cling film and store in the fridge for 20 minutes. This helps the biscuits maintain their shape. If you&#8217;re making the ice cream as well, this gives you time to make the ice cream.
 11. Remove from the oven and slice into biscuits.
 12. Play on the tray. (If you want a more round shape you could roll each slice into a ball then press down until the tray lightly with your fingers).
 13. Bake in the over for about 12-15 minutes until biscuits have some colour (they will be darker around the edges and bottoms).
 14. Remove from the tray onto a rack to cool. They were harden as they cool.

**Lady grey icecream**

_Ingredients_

  * 2 cups coconut milk
  * 1 cup rice milk
  * 4 earl grey tea bags or two tablespoons loose leaf earl grey tea
  * 2 tablespoons orange zest
  * Juice of 1/2 orange
  * 1/3 cup caster sugar or agave syrup to taste
  * 2 tablespoons coconut oil
  * 1/4 cup of potato or cornflour

_Instructions_

  1. Place milks in a saucepan.
  2. Add tea and  bring to the boil.
  3. Turn off the stove and along tea to seep for 30 minutes.
  4. Add orange zest, and sugar or agave and coconut oil. I recommend putting a little sweetener in and adding more to taste as you like.
  5. Whisk well.
  6. Place potato or cornflour in a cup and add a few tablespoons of the milk mix to make a paste.
  7. Add to the saucepan, whisking as you go.
  8. Place in the freezer for three hours. You need to remove it every 30 minutes (or when you remember) ahd whisk to reduce the iceyness of the mixture.
  9. Once set remove from the freezer 10 minutes before serving to soften.
 10. Serve with biscuits or even iced tea!
