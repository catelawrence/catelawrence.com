  I&#8217;m kicking this series off for an opportunity for bloggers in Europe (and UK) to get to know each other and share a bit about where they live. Locals and expats are welcome and please cut and paste the questions and then add your link at the bottom and link back to this post on A Travelling Cook so that everyone&#8217;s posts get seen and shared. Add some pics too if you like!








  <em>(I&#8217;ll answer the questions myself a bit later, just finishing some work)</em>
