  The salad was a result of accidentally buying millet instead of quinoa a few months ago and discovering I really like it! Millet and quinoa look very similar as you can see by <a href="https://ancientharvest.com/ancient-grains/organic-millet/">this</a> web page and the images below and the names are similar in Deutsch, especially when they are side by side in the supermarket and you are in a rush!

  Quinoa (Andenhirse in Deutsch)

  Millet (Hirse in Deutsch)



  Millet is an excellent source of protein and is high in fibre, B vitamins and magnesium. It has a nutty taste similar to quinoa but cooks down to more of a creamy dish than quinoa.



  This is a really simple salad. I bought the edamame beans and snow peas from the freezer section of the asian supermarket in our street. If you don&#8217;t have millet (or quinoa), pre cooked rice or even rice noodles would work wonderfully in this salad!



  <i>Ingredients</i>


<li class="li1">
  3/4 cup Millet
</li>
<li class="li1">
  1 Capsicum, cored and sliced
</li>
<li class="li1">
  1/3 cup Snow peas
</li>
<li class="li1">
  1/2 cup Edamame beans
</li>
<li class="li1">
  Spring Onion, sliced 
</li>
<li class="li1">
  1/4 cup Basil leaves, torn
</li>
<li class="li1">
  1/4 Red Cabbage, shredded
</li>
<li class="li1">
  1 cup Broccoli, cut into pieces
</li>
<li class="li1">
  1 can of corn kernels (sugar and salt free), drained
</li>
<li class="li1">
  1 Avocado, peeled and diced (leave until serving)
</li>


  <i>Dressing</i>


<li class="li1">
  1 clove garlic, finely diced
</li>
<li class="li1">
  Ginger, finely diced or grated (equivalent to about 1 teaspoon
</li>
<li class="li1">
  1 tablespoon soy sauce
</li>
<li class="li1">
  1 tablespoon sesame seeds
</li>
<li class="li1">
  2 tablespoons Rice wine vinegar
</li>
<li class="li1">
  1/2 cup sesame oil
</li>


  <strong>To make dressing:</strong>


<li class="p2">
  Finely mince the garlic and ginger and put in a small jar.
</li>
<li class="p2">
  Add all the remaining dressing ingredients and mix.
</li>
<li class="p2">
  Set aside so that the flavours can intensify as you chop the rest of the ingredients. You can store any leftovers in the capped jar in the fridge
</li>


  <strong>To cook millet:</strong>


<li class="p2">
  Cook millet by firstly dry frying 3/4 of a cup of millet in a non stick fry pan until it changes collour and smells kind of nutty.
</li>
<li class="p2">
  Then place 3/4 cup and 2 cups water in a saucepan.
</li>
<li class="p2">
  Simmer for about 25 minutes until liquid is evaporated. I like to add 1 teaspoon of vegetable stock powder to the liquid for flavour but this is totally optional!
</li>
<li class="p2">
  Allow to completely cool.
</li>


  <em>To make the rest of the salad:</em>


<li class="p2">
  Thaw the edamame and snow peas (If you&#8217;ve bought frozen like me) . I place mine in a plastic container with a lid -along with the broccoli as I like mine lightly cooked- and cook in the microwave for 2 minutes. 
</li>
<li class="p2">
  Allow to cool completely before removing from the container.
</li>
<li class="p2">
  Remove edamame beans from their pods.
</li>
<li class="p2">
  Assemble millet, and all vegetables in a bowl or on a plate
</li>
<li class="p2">
  Add the dressing and mix gently. You can serve straight away, or you can let everything marinate and serve later. In this case I would put the reserve the avocado and slice and add to the salad upon serving.
