I was wanting to make a side dish the other night and i thought of the green bean dish I had enjoyed in many Turkish restaurants back in Australia. It&#8217;s a good dish in that you use either fresh, tinned or frozen veggies (or a combination) and it can be enjoyed hot or cold. I think it would work lovely as a side dish at a barbecue or picnic served cold.

_Ingredients_

  * 3/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
  * 3 garlic cloves
  * 2 onions
  * 3 cups green beans (fresh or frozen)
  * 1 cup snow peas
  * 1 zucchini
  * 4 large tomatoes (or 1 can of tinned crushed tomatoes).
  * 1 teaspoon sugar
  * 1/2 teaspoon salt
  * Water

_Instructions_

  1. Warm a glug of your olive oil in a fry pan.
  2. Dice garlic,onions, zucchini, tomatoes and top and tail beans if you&#8217;re using fresh beans.
  3. Cook onions and garlic until soft.
  4. Add the rest of the vegetable and fry for 1 minute.
  5. Add salt and sugar and stir.
  6. Top with water until the vegetables are covered and place a lid on the pan.
  7. Cook on a low heat for about an hour until the water has evaporated and you have a sticky, tomatey bean mix.
