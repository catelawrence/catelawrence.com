Lemon butter is a sweet conserve which works wonderfully on toast, scones, sandwiched between sponge cake and dripped over desserts. I used to make it as one of the few &#8216;egg&#8217; dishes I liked (the only others being meringues and pavlovas). But now, thanks to a simple can of chickpeas, it can be made egg free but just as rich and delicious! Serve it with [chickpea meringues](https://atravellingcook.com/2015/05/egg-free-meringues.html)Â and coconut cream for a wonderful dessert!




  <b>Lemon Butter</b>



  <i>Ingredients</i>


<li class="p2">
  Brine from 1 tin of chickpeas
</li>
<li class="p2">
  1 cup sugar (start with less then add until you get the desired sweetness, you can certainly add more)
</li>
<li class="p2">
  250g dairy free butter
</li>
<li class="p2">
  zest and juice of four lemons.
</li>

_Instructions_

<ol class="ol1">
  <li class="li2">
    Place tin of chickpeas in the freezer. This is not absolutely essential but makes the brine become frothy faster than without the cold.
  </li>
  <li class="li2">
    Drain the liquid into a bowl.
  </li>
  <li class="li2">
    Beat until white and frothy and slightly foamy with egg beater or an electric mixer. It is worth noting that you are aiming for a mix a bit of foam rather than anything near stiff meringues. It will reduce further when it cooks on the stove also.
  </li>
  <li class="li2">
    Place the brine mix on the stove and simmer on a low heat until the mixture is reduced and thickened.
  </li>
  <li class="li2">
    Grate lemon zest and squeeze juice from the lemons into a small bowl. I pop the lemons in the microwave for 30 seconds to get even more juice from the lemons.
  </li>
  <li class="li2">
    Add the butter to the brine and allow to melt.
  </li>
  <li class="li2">
    Add lemon juice, zest sugar and stir well.
  </li>
  <li class="li2">
    Simmer until thick, this usually takes about 30 minutes, it will thicken further upon cooling.
  </li>
  <li class="li2">
    Pour lemon curd into sterilised jars.
  </li>
</ol>
