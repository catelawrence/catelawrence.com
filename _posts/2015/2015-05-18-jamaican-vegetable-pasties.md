Pastry is a fine thing, and is a great way to liven up any less than inspired veggies in the bottom of your fridge. Savoury Pasties and pies aren&#8217;t really a thing here in Germany. I thought for a little while about starting a little pie making enterprise upon moving to Berlin but discovered there are three here already started by Australians!

I was lucky enough to find some sweet potatoes, they aren&#8217;t available all year round, so I decided to make some pasties using my [Jamaican spice mix](https://atravellingcook.com/2015/02/red-beans-quinoa-and-jerk-spice-soup.html). I&#8217;ve made this pastry quite a few times ( it was devised through trial and error a few years ago), if you want a really flaky pastry, feel free to double the amount of coconut oil.

These freeze beautifully and a great for lunch or with veggies, mash or a pasta dish for dinner.

_Ingredients_

  * Splash or coconut or olive oil
  * 1 red onion
  * 2 cloves garlic
  * 2 cm ginger
  * 2 teaspoons [Jamaican spice mix ](https://atravellingcook.com/2015/02/red-beans-quinoa-and-jerk-spice-soup.html)(you can certainly add more if you like it extra spicy)
  * 1 sweet potato
  * 1 carrot
  * 1 can corn kernels, drained (or corn fresh from the cob)
  * 1 tin kidney beans, drained
  * 1 tin/cup coconut milk

Pastry:

  * 3 cups all-purpose flour
  * 1/2 teaspoon salt
  * 1 tablespoon curry powder
  * 1 tablespoon tumeric
  * 1/2 cup coconut oil
  * 3/4 cup iced water

_To make pastry:_

  1. Combine flour, salt and spices in a bowl, stirring well.
  2. Add coconut oil (warmed so that it is melty but not boiling hot).
  3. Rub the mix through your fingertips so it begins to resemble bread crumbs.
  4. Add ice water slow and form into a ball with your hands.
  5. Knead lightly for about 2-3 minutes.
  6. Wrap in clingfilm and store in the fridge for 30 minutes.

_To make filling:_

  1. Warm pan with a splash of olive or coconut oil.
  2. Dice onion, garlic and ginger and add to the pan
  3. Add spice mix and cook for 5 minutes until fragrant and onion is becoming translucent (Don&#8217;t allow spices to burn! Burnt spices are horrendous).
  4. Dice sweet potato and carrot and add to the mix
  5. Add corn and kidney beans and coconut milk and stir well.
  6. Allow to simmer until potatoes have become tender and the mix is nice and thick- you don&#8217;t want it soupy as it&#8217;s going into pastry!
  7. Allow to cool before making the pasties.

_To make up:_

Roll out pastry on a floured board until nice and thin.

  1. Cut into desired shapes (you could do squares, trianges, circles)-I usually end up with a bit of a mix.
  2. Place a generous heap of the potato mix in the centre of your pastry and brush edges of pastry with dairy free milk or water.
  3. Seal edges with your fingertips.
  4. Brush pasties with milk and put a little hole in the top.
  5. Bake pasties on a paper lined baking try and bake until dough is golden brown and cooked through, about for 25 to 35 minutes.
  6. Serve with your favourite chilli or tomato sauce!
