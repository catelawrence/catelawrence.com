Corn fritters are a breakfast dish that I really enjoy but realised I hadn&#8217;t had for ages! I simply had to make a batch. They are cheap, quick and easy to make. I fried these fritters in a pan but they also work perfectly well baked in the oven, although baking will take longer than frying, probably about 20 minutes on 180c.  Alternative topping include pesto, barbecue sauce and sweet chilli sauce. The fritters also work wonderfully in a sandwich on lovely fresh bread!

**Corn fritters
  
** _Ingredients:_

  * 1 onion, finely diced
  * 3 cloves garlic, peeled and finely diced
  * 2 red chillies (or to taste), finely diced
  * 1 tin corn kernels, drained (or corn from 1 refresh corn on the cob)
  * 1 zucchini grated
  * salt and pepper to taste
  * 1.5 cups flour
  * 1 cup plant milk ( I used rice milk)
  * olive oil (or oil of choice) to cook

_Instructions:_

  1. Fry onion, garlic and chillies for 2-3 minutes with a splash of oil. Allow to cool
  2. Meanwhile, place corn kernels, zucchini, salt and pepper into a bowl and stir well
  3. Add flour and mix.
  4. Gradually add milk. To make chunky fritters (as opposed to those that are a bit more pancake like) you want the mix to be like wet veggie patties rather than a runny batter.
  5. Heat 3 cm oil in non-stick pan to a medium heat.
  6. Gently place fritters in oil and fry until golden on both sides (about 5 minutes per side.
  7. Place onto absorbent kitchen paper to remove excess oil.
  8. Serve hot with guacamole

**Guacamole:
  
** _Ingredients:_

  * 1 avocado, peeled and deseeded
  * Juice of 1/2 lime
  * 1/2 small red onion, finely diced
  * 1 small red chilli diced
  * 1/2 teaspoon cumin (more to taste)
  * Salt and pepper to taste

_ Instructions_

  1. Mash avocado in a small bowl with a fork.
  2. Add remaining ingredients and adjust seasonings to taste.
