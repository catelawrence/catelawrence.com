I recently went foraging in a park in Prenzlauer berg when we pickled some lovely dandeliions and nettles. I decided to make a dandelion syrup with the dandelion heads. It has a lovely amber colour and can be used in place of honey, or as a tonic when you have a sore throat.

_Ingredients_

  * 4 cups  dandelion flowers
  * 4  cups water
  * 3 cups sugar (add more to taste)
  * Juice and zest of ½ lemon

_Instructions_

  1. Cut off yellow part of flowers. Place in a saucepan with 4 cups water.
  2. Bring just to a boil, turn off heat, then cover and let sit overnight.
  3. The next day, strain and press liquid out of spent flowers.
  4. Add sugar and lemon to the liquid and heat slowly, stirring now and again.
  5. Simmer on a low heat for up to one hour until reduced to a thick, honey-like syrup.
  6. Store in sterilised jars.
