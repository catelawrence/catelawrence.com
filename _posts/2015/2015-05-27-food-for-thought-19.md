I&#8217;ve been pretty busy the last few weeks. I&#8217;ve almost finished my second e-recipe book and I did my first Berlin workshop over the weekend (with plenty more scheduled).



As a result of moving countries, I&#8217;ve had to spend quite some time building up kitchen equipment and supplies which is time consuming and expensive. I&#8217;ve got things second hand where I can, t&#8217;s not always viable but we&#8217;ve had some really good successes with finding some of the things that we need at good prices.

Hopefully I will get enough [workshop bookings](https://atravellingcook.com/cooking-classes) over the coming months to make the costs worth while, I really enjoy teaching cooking, it&#8217;s always great fun to get back in the kitchen in front of a class.

Things I&#8217;ve been looking at and reading:
