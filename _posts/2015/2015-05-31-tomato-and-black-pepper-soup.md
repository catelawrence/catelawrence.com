Before you think &#8216;oh yawn, another boring tomato soup&#8217;, I&#8217;d really encourage you to give this recipe a try. I developed it as part of my upcoming recipe ebook but I really wanted to share it with you as it&#8217;s so insanely delicious. I have a confession to make, the photo above is not the one that will be in the book, I had a shoot planned for the soup, only to realise that I&#8217;d eaten almost all of it, it was so incredibly tasty! Don&#8217;t skimp on the black pepper and (non-dairy) butter, it really makes a tomato soup into something special!



**Ingredients:**

  * 6 medium tomatoes
  * 2 red capsicum
  * 3-4 garlic cloves
  * 1 tsp turmeric
  * 2 tsp freshly ground black pepper
  * 1 tsp ginger
  * 1 tsp cumin
  * 1 tablespoon oil
  * Water
  * 1 teaspoon sugar
  * 1 teaspoon salt
  * 2 tablespoons non-dairy butter

&nbsp;

_Instructions:_

  1. Halve tomatoes and halve and deseed capsicums.
  2. Lightly sprinkle with oil and place in a hot oven (about 180c) for 10 minutes until they have coloured and the tomatoes are soft.
  3. Dry roast the spices until fragrant in a large saucepan.
  4. Add tablespoon oil and stir well.
  5. Dice the garlic and add to the pan.
  6. Remove the tomatoes and capsicum from the oven and dice.
  7. Add to the saucepan with 4 cups water, 1 teaspoon sugar and 1 teaspoon salt.
  8. Allow to boil until the mixture has reduced by half.
  9. Blend with a stick blender (or leave in chunks if you prefer)
 10. Add 2 tablespoons butter, stir through and serve.
