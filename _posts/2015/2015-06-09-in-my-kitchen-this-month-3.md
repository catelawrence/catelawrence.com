It&#8217;s been a busy month here in Berlin. I&#8217;ve spent a lot of time rebuilding my kitchen equipment as it was too expensive to ship all that much of it from Australia. Things like chopping boards, blenders, bowls, pots, jars etc. I would say that most of these are more expensive here but slightly better quality.



I still spent a lot of time being amused by what I find in the supermarkets, like these massive jars of Nutella:

I&#8217;ve also taught a couple of cooking workshops so I&#8217;ve been spending lots of time buying ingThe hardest thing to find so far as been an appropriate dairy free acidophilus lactobasilius yoghurt starter as the soy yoghurts here are too low in these to ferment yoghurt. I&#8217;ve tried two and also two commercial brands,and all have failed, very frustrating! I&#8217;ll be spending more time searching for a good substitute.

I&#8217;m also trying to finish my second e-recipe book &#8216;Vegan soups, salads and sides&#8217; and I have a little idea for the next one!

Besides that, I&#8217;ve been cooking for meals and for fun. Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been making:
