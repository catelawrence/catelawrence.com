I&#8217;ve like to say i have lots of lovely photos of this pesto sitting prettily in a jar, but the truth is, we ate a big jar of it in three days. Spread on breakfast toast, dolloped over soup, stirred through pasta, totally morelish and delicious. It uses basil from our balcony which is wonderful, as I&#8217;m so enjoying having a balcony again. i&#8217;ll be definitely making this again so stay tuned for more pics.

My love of chilli oil is well know, as attested to in [this](https://atravellingcook.com/2015/06/asian-quinoa-meatballs.html) post. It again trumps, making this pesto into a delicacy that you&#8217;ll find excuses to eat. It&#8217;s one of those socially unacceptable recipes due to the liberal use of raw garlic but just brush your teeth after and you&#8217;ll be fine!

_Ingredients_

  * 1/2 cup cashews
  * 3 garlic cloves
  * Glug of olive oil
  * 1/3 cup chilli flakes in oil
  * 1 cup basil leaves
  * Sprinkle of salt (optional)

_Instructions:_
