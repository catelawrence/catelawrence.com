It&#8217;s been quite cool the last couple of days so I was craving a wintery kind of dish. I came up with this pie, which utilizes a couple of my favourite ingredients, mushrooms and white beans. I would have made a proper pie shape crust, but I don&#8217;t actually have a pie dish so I made something a bit more like a galette. Still tastes delicious though!

_Ingredients:_

  * 1/4 cup dried Chinese mushrooms

  3. Dice garlic and onions and fry in olive oil.
  4. Drain beans (don&#8217;t throw out the liquid, use it to make <a href="https://atravellingcook.com/2015/05/egg-free-meringues.html" target="_blank">these </a>meringues)
  5. Rinse beans and add to pan.
  6. Add ale, sprinkle on flour, stock powder and salt and pepper and stir well.
  7. Let to simmer until at least half of the liquid has evaporated and the mixture has thickened. Allow to cool before filling the pie.

 10. Place cooled mix in the centre and gradually fold in the edges.
