I&#8217;ve been rather neglecting my blog as I&#8217;ve been crazy busy with workshops, trying to finish recipe e book number two (it will be launched on Monday) and just life in general. The weekend commemorates one year of living as an expat in Deutschland, I&#8217;ll be writing more about this next week.

I&#8217;ve been attending lots of events as well which is always fun as it&#8217;s quite a hot week here in Berlin. Here&#8217;s some cute art from a venue we went to last night:

[<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1041 size-large" src="/images/atc-migrate/2015/07/2015-07-02-19.29.30-768x1024.jpg" alt="2015-07-02 19.29.30" width="768" height="1024" />](/images/atc-migrate/2015/07/2015-07-02-19.29.30.jpg)

Here&#8217;s a pick of Chris and I taken at last weekend&#8217;s Christopher Day Parade (Berlin&#8217;s version of Pride March). We are very happy that people in the US in same sex relationships now have the legal option of marriage and impatiently await the same rights for our fellow Australians&#8230;

I&#8217;ve also been doing some writing for tech website Sitepoint, regarding mobile apps from a user perspective. Here&#8217;s my latest:

[Can Apps help prevent violence?](https://www.sitepoint.com/can-apps-help-prevent-violence/), Cate Lawrence, _Sitepoint
  
_ _-_Would love to know what you think!

**Here&#8217;s some things that have caught my attention:**

[This](https://alanajonesmann.com/2015/06/wallpaper-cakes-tropical-prints/) cake blows my mind-amazing!

I love [these](https://alexandrasoldatova.com/portfolio/it-must-be-beautiful/) bus shelters in Belarus, decorated by unknown artists:

I would love a set of shelves like [this](https://www.designsponge.com/2015/07/check-out-the-cook-republic-kitchen-designed-to-share.html) in my kitchen (and all the equipment of course). As much as a try to live without lots of stuff as an expat who sold everything to move here, it would be nice to have the luxury at times&#8230;[
