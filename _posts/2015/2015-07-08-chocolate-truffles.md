This is probably the quickest, cheapest and easiest recipe I&#8217;ll ever post, so you have no reason not to make it!



_Ingredients:_

  * 2 cups pitted dates
  * 1 teaspoon coconut oil
  * 1 cup cacao powder (or more to taste)
  * 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon powder
  * pinch chilli powder (optional)

_Instructions:_

  1. Soak dates in boiling water for 1 hour
  2. Process in blender with the coconut oil and spices until a paste is formed.
  3. Place in a bowl with 3/4 cup of cacoa powder.
  4. Still well until ingredients are well combined.
  5. Place in fridge for 30 minute until the mixture is firmer.
  6. Place the remainder of the cacoa powder onto a plate
  7. Roll paste into balls and roll the balls into the cacao until each truffle is covered.
  8. Refrigerate until ready to eat!

_Variations:_ You can add black pepper, crushed nuts, coconut flakes and dried fruit to your truffles for a variety of flavours.
