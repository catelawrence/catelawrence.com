I've just got home from a weekend away in [Wittenberg.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wittenberg) Wittenberg is a city with a long historical history of religious reformation through the efforts of Martin Luther in creating the Protestant Church as a break away from Catholicism. I am no historian (religious history is a love of my husband) but I'm never one to say no to a weekend away.

Unfortunately the castle was closed due to restorations, but we did visit some churches and historical homes.

Luckily a wine festival was on over the weekend, so we enjoyed some really good wine. It made all the religious history a lot more tolerable.

We were amused by the brewery truck, delivering tourists to their destinations. We walked of course, although it was a bit hot.

The first evening we enjoyed a fantastic dinner at the [Brauhaus Wittenberg.](https://www.brauhaus-wittenberg.de/) The menu was traditional eastern german fare but was well cooked with lovely wine and we sat in a gorgeous courtyard. I didn't take any foodie pics as it was a bit too dark. I later learned that the Brahaus had accommodation and I think it would be a fun place to stay.

We stayed at the [Best Western](https://www.bestwestern.de/hotels/Wittenberg-Lutherstadt/BEST-WESTERN-Stadtpalais-Wittenberg). A lovely big room with the typical german bed of two singles stuck together and European pillows which made me miss the 'normal' pillows that we bought online at Marks and Spencer and had sent over. European pillows are just too soft for us! But the room had a lovely big bath in the bathroom (like most german accommodation) and great wifi.

We enjoyed a free breakfast each day, especially the fruit salad, bread rolls, vegetable salad, different cheeses and coffee. I don't know why more people don't have salad for breakfast.

We are both creatures of habit and love a cup of tea before going to sleep and first thing in the morning (me whilst Chris has coffee). The guest book in the room said that coffee and tea were available so we went to ask one night for the machine. The night porter left reception and came back this this:

Basically it's a working percolator coffee machine, filter papers, instant coffee sachets (no real coffee), herbal tea sachets (and only one caffeinated tea), and that horrid creamer stuff. We thought it rather odd!

We went on a boat trip down the river Elbe which was rather boring if I'm honest. I was feeling quite grumpy as it was a bit of a walk to get to the boat and I hate hot weather-bring on autumn! Due to a glass of champagne and the hot weather I even had a bit of a doze. The highlight was seeing a naked fisherman, happily fishing with a fishing rod on the bank of the river, everything out for display. East Germans are quite liberal about public nudity, as we learned when we lived in Leipzig.

Perhaps the funniest thing after moving to Berlin is that we'd forgotten some of the traditional East German traits in the 45 plus age group. [Schlager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schlager_music) music. Bleached hair with mullets. Double denim and _Camp David_ clothing on every second local person. A dour expression which is at odds with the warmth and helpfulness of the East Germans from my experience.

Given my love of retro, I also loved the [Haus der Gershicte](https://www.pflug-ev.de/). It featured kitchens, bedrooms and living rooms of the 1920s to 1990s and also included a village pub, a dance bar, a youth room of the 1980s and a village supermarket documenting life of the Weimar Republic, post war period and GDR.

As well as fabulous wine, we also had great cheese and fruit cake and a wonderful asian meal (like most Asian restaurants in East Germany the cuisine included Thai, Vietnamese, Thai and Chinese. But the noodles were smoky, you could tasty fresh herbs and lemon grass in the stir fry, the spring rolls were homemade and the staff were lovely.

I had a good time in Wittenberg, and I'd definitely go back-it would be beautiful to visit in winter, especially!
