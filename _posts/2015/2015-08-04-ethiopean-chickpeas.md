Since using chickpea brine to make [egg free lemon butter](https://atravellingcook.com/2015/05/egg-free-lemon-butter.html) and [meringues](https://atravellingcook.com/2015/05/egg-free-meringues.html), I find myself with lots of chickpeas to cook. I make lots of [hummus](https://atravellingcook.com/2015/04/smoky-hummus.html) but I also enjoy chickpeas in salads and one pot dishes. Here's one I used to make back in Australia when I was teaching cooking to Chinese migrants and their kids. We'd add whatever veggies were in season to bulk it up, and everyone enjoyed it, even the kids who claimed they didn't like vegetables!

_Ingredients:_

-   2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
-   1 large red onion, finely chopped

-   ½ teaspoon cayenne pepper
-   ½ teaspoon paprika
-   ½ teaspoon ginger
-   ½ teaspoon salt
-   ½ teaspoon black pepper

_Instructions:_

-   Add chickpeas and water and bring to a boil.
-   Reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, until vegetables are tender and the flavour developed, about 15 minutes, adding a bit more water if needed.
-   About 10 minutes before the stew is ready, stir in peas and taste to adjust seasonings.Serve with rice.
