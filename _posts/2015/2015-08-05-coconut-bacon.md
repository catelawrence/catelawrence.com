I started making coconut bacon back in Australia as an alternative to the pig derived stuff. I'm a big fan of [liquid smoke](https://atravellingcook.com/2015/01/vegan-ingredients-resource-list.html) and I love the smoky, sweet, salty flavour that coconut bacon imparts. Use it where you would use bacon- mixed through pasta or salad, a top a baked potato, in a sandwich, it's delicious!

My bacon is quite dark as I like to make sure it is quite crisp and I also use dark ingredients like

[liquid smoke](https://atravellingcook.com/2015/01/vegan-ingredients-resource-list.html) and tamari. You can of course cook it little less!

_Ingredients:_

-   2 cup large flake, unsweetened coconut
-   1 tablespoon liquid smoke
-   2 tablespoons tamari
-   1 tablespoon water
-   1 tablespoon maple syrup or agave

_Instructions:_

1.  Combine ingredients together. mix and make sure the coconut is evenly coated.
2.  Heat fry pan to a low heat
3.  Add coconut and cook until crisp, you ideally want some softer bits and some darker crunchy bits. It will continue to crisp as it cools.
