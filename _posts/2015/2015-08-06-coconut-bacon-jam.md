As a [cooking teacher](https://atravellingcook.com/cooking-classes) who teaches jam making and preserving, I was intrigued to come across bacon jam a few years ago. I like making coconut bacon so I decided to have a go at bacon jam. It's a lovely sweet, salty, smoky kind of flavour which the balsamic vinegar really brings out. I tried some for breakfast and it was delicious!

_Instructions:_

-   2 onions
-   4 garlic
-   2 cups coconut
-   2 tablespoons butter
-   1 tablespoon soy sauce
-   1/2 cup coffee
-   1/3 cup balsamic
-   1/3 cup sugar
-   1 tablespoon liquid smoke
-   2 and 1/2 cups water

_Ingredients:_

1.  Heat pan on a low heat.
2.  Add onions dry and cook until they are softening and becoming translucent (about 10 minutes). Stir as needed.
3.  Add butter and stir well.
4.  Add garlic and cook until the garlic is softened.
5.  Add soy sauce remaining ingredients except water and cook until the sugar has melted into the pan and the liquids are coming together.
6.  Add 1 cup water and simmer on the lowest heat for 1.5 hours. Add remaining water as needed, you want enough liquid to soften the coconut some and also form a bit of a sauce. Stir well as needed. Adjust seasonings as you like: more liquid smoke, salt or balsamic perhaps?
7.  Remove from the heat and allow to cool.
8.  Place in blender/food processor and pulse lightly to break down the coconut and combine the ingredients further. Not too much, you would a little bit of texture not a mousse (unless that's the texture you would like)!
9.  Store in sterilised jars in the fridge.
