It&#8217;s been an interesting month here in Berlin. Summer is here which means hot sunny days with little respite so I&#8217;m currently living off homemade sorbet, [hummus](https://atravellingcook.com/2015/04/smoky-hummus.html), salads and smoothies-it&#8217;s certainly much easier to avoid the German bakeries full of pastries when the weather is hot.

After discovering that my passport has expired, I compiled a little [recipe ebook](https://sellfy.com/p/q88w/) of some of my favourite unpublished recipes. It&#8217;s a mere $1 and the proceeds ensure I am a legal migrant who is able to return to Australia if I have an emergency

Prior to the heatwave I tried making some [eggless meringues](https://atravellingcook.com/2015/05/egg-free-meringues.html) using a little [pickled beetroot](https://atravellingcook.com/2014/08/pickled-beetroots-and-beetroot-bread.html) juice for the acid in the meringues and also to allow some colour using natural ingredients. Quite tasty!

On one of the few cool days, I made a delicious [corn, cauliflower and quinoa soup](https://atravellingcook.com/2015/07/sweet-corn-cauliflower-and-quinoa-soup.html)-can&#8217;t wait for another cool day so I can make some more! [

I did a birthday cake by request for a birthday party. It was an interesting experience especially as the request was for a sugar free cake using agave. I actually think I spent half the money I earnt on agave alone! Talking to other who do cake making as a living, I don&#8217;t know how they make it financially viable. Everyone I spoke to who has done similar work admitted that it was not.

[I made some](/images/atc-migrate/2015/08/DSC0550.jpg) [coconut bacon](https://atravellingcook.com/2015/08/coconut-bacon.html)

And also some [coconut bacon jam](https://atravellingcook.com/2015/08/coconut-bacon-jam.html) (very tasty!)

I bought a cute little sugar jar for 3€ [<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1191" src="/images/atc-migrate/2015/08/11879084_10152911472831249_9217576674444375942_o.jpg" alt="11879084_10152911472831249_9217576674444375942_o" width="1080" height="1080" />](/images/atc-migrate/2015/08/11879084_10152911472831249_9217576674444375942_o.jpg)

We also finally got some decent kitchen furniture! No longer living in boxes, hurrah!
