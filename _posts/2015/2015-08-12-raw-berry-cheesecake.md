This is a really easy cheesecake made using lots of great, easy to find ingredients. I would have take a photo of the whole cheesecake but it was eaten before this was possible!

_Ingredients:_

Crust:

-   1 cup cashews
-   1/2 cup shredded coconut
-   1 teaspoon vanilla essence (to taste)
-   2 tablespoon melted dairy free butter or coconut oil

_Filling:_

-   2 cups raw cashews (soaked in water 4-6 hours)
-   1/4 cup agave syrup
-   1/4 cup coconut oil
-   1/2 cup non-dairy milk
-   Juice of 1/2 lemon

_Topping:_

-   2 cups mixed berries
-   Icing sugar/agave to taste (optional)

_Instructions:_

Soak cashews for 4-6 hours (or if you forget, boil in a saucepan with plenty of water for 15 minutes or until soft)

_Crust:_

-   Cover bottom of a spring form cake tin with baking paper.
-   Put 1 cup cashews, in blender with coconut, vanilla essence and butter/oil and blitz until a paste forms.
-   Press into bottom of cake tin with your finger tips until the bottom of the cake tin is evenly covered.
-   Place in the freezer until firm.

_Filling:_

-   Mix filling ingredients in blender until smooth and creamy (add a little water as needed)
-   Smooth over cold base and pop back in the freezer for 30 minutes.

_Topping:_

1.  Dice berries (leaving some whole) and mix with sugar/agave to taste.
2.  Spoon over the filling and leave in the freezer until 30 minutes before serving.

_Variations:_

You can vary the topping with different fruits or chocolate, add cacao and peppermint (like in my [chocolate peppermint torte](https://atravellingcook.com/2014/12/chocolate-peppermint-torte.html)) or orange zest or coffee to the filling or use dates instead of coconut in the crust for a change. I've made it loads of times and it always is incredibly popular.
