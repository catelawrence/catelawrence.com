Living in Germany, dishes like potato dumplings and spätzle are common place on menus serving traditional Deutsch fare. Most involved eggs, dairy and of course a spätzle maker to get the requisite noodle like dough. Not being in possession of one, I decided to make potato dumplings.

These are vegan, using white bean brine (also known as [aquafaba](https://aquafaba.com/)) a wonderful substance which cooks previously poured down the drain. Now, it can be used to make all kinds of egg substitute recipes like these [meringues](https://atravellingcook.com/2015/05/egg-free-meringues.html) and [lemon butter](https://atravellingcook.com/2015/05/egg-free-lemon-butter.html). In this instance the brine provides a binding agent, enabling the potatoes and flour to combine without being floury or too wet.

_Ingredients_

-   4 large potatoes (or equivalent) l
-   2 cups flour, 1/2 cup or more for working dough
-   1/2 tsp. salt
-   1/4 cup white bean/chick pea brine

Instructions:

1.  Boil potatoes until tender then drain and allow to cool completely.
2.  Peel potatoes.
3.  Mash potatoes well onto a big dry chopping board (or table top), adding no water or other liquid at this stage.
4.  Put a pan of water on the stove and get it boiling.
5.  Sprinkle the flour and salt over the top
6.  Form a well in the middle and add half the brine
7.  Carefully bring the flour and potato into the centre to create a moist dough, adding brine as needed.
8.  You can add a little flour as needed but you probably will be ok without it.
9.  Form a combined dough with your hands, kneading gently. Add a little flour to your board to prevent sticking. You want a soft dough without adding too much flour or you will end up with a rather floury taste.
10. Shape dough into a loaf and slice lengthways into strips.
11. Cut strips into small pieces roughly the same size and gently roll them into balls with your hands.
12. Add to boiling water in a few batches.
13. Once the dumplings rise to the top (this takes about a minute) they are ready.
14. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain well.
15. Toss them into a pan with a sauce you've already made and cook together for about 2 minutes or pop in a bowl and top with a sauce of choice.

_I'll be posting some sauces to complement the gnocchi over the weekend!_
