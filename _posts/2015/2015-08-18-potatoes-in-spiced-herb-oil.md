I've been making variations of this oil for different recipes for a number of years but I realised the other day that I've never written it down. It's super easy to make, smells and tastes amazing ( Chris actually makes me close the kitchen door whenever I make it as he says the smell makes him starving) and is very adaptable to to what you have on hand and the ingredients you like. I like to replenish my spices quite often and this is a great way to use up odds and ends. I like to make a note of any changes to the recipe (say adding more garlic powder or salt or whatever) for next time as tasting hot oil is not viable! You can of course allow the oil to cool and adjust flavours as you like.

_Ingredients_

-   1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil
-   1/2 teaspoon yellow mustard seeds
-   1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary
-   1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
-   1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
-   1/2 teaspoon onion powder
-   1/2 teaspoon hot paprika
-   1 teaspoon garlic powder
-   1/2 teaspoon salt
-   1/2 teaspoon black pepper
-   1 tablespoon lemon juice

Instructions:

1.  Warm olive oil in a small saucepan.
2.  Add dried herbs and spices and cook for 2 minutes or until fragrant ensuring that they do not burn. (The oil will of course be very hot)
3.  Allow to cool and stir through the lemon juice.
4.  Store in a jar in the refridgerator. I know some people like to keep oil out of the fridge to infuse but in my experience making nature skincare products, it can become rancid quite quickly in hot weather so the fridge really is safest.

_Potatoes in spiced herb oil:_

Here the use of [nutritional yeast](https://atravellingcook.com/2015/01/vegan-ingredients-resource-list.html) and rice flour makes a lovely cheesy flavoured crust on the potatoes, making them very moreish, this dish never has leftovers!

-   4-5 large potatoes, cut into pieces and precooked ( I pop them in the microwave on high for 5 minutes )
-   2 tablespoons nutritional yeast
-   1 tablespoon rice flour
-   1/4 cup of spiced herb oil

_Instructions:_

1.  Combine potatoes with nutritional yeast and flour. The easiest way to do this is to place the potatoes, yeast and flour in a big zip-lock bag, seal and shake well.
2.  Heat oil in pan
3.  Add potatoes and stir well.
4.  Allow to fry watching carefully for any hot spots in the pan. I like to squash the potatoes a little with a wooden spoon or potato masher to increase the crispy bits.
5.  Allow to drain well on kitchen absorbent paper and serve.

_Other uses for Spiced herbed oil:_

-   Lightly saute onions, garlic and mushroom in the oil. Stir through cooked pasta or [potato dumplings](https://atravellingcook.com/2015/08/egg-free-potato-dumplings.html).
-   Use as a flavour component for a quick curry, soup or sauce
-   Roast carrots and pumpkin in it in the oven
-   Dip bread in it (especially good if you use homemade bread) and have a little balsamic vinegar along side the oil.
-   Combine with lemon juice and white wine vinegar\[
