I have been working on some menu ideas for a catering enterprise for tech events that Chris and I will be launching in September. This cheese has the soften and smoothness of mozzarella with some delicious extra flavours. I use it for making [antipasto kebabs](https://atravellingcook.com/2015/08/antipasto-kebabs.html).

The recipe does take several days though due to naturally fermenting the cheese for extra tang and taste.

The recipe is inspired by the work of [Miyoko Schinner](https://www.artisanveganlife.com/). I've enjoyed a number of her recipes over the years although I tend to using them as a starting board and tweak them accordingly.

_Instructions:_

-   1 cup plain, unsweetened soy yogurt ( I used my homemade yoghurt)
-   1 cup raw cashews, soaked in water for 6 hours then drained
-   1 cup [rejuvelac](https://atravellingcook.com/2015/08/rejuvelac.html), divided in half
-   1 1/2 teaspoons sea salt
-   1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
-   3 tablespoons tapioca flour
-   1 tablespoon agar powder

_Instructions:_

1.  Combine the yogurt, cashews, a half cup of the water, and salt in a blender and process until smooth and well blended.
2.  Transfer to a container, cover loosely, and set aside for 24 hours until slightly tangy.
3.  Whisk in the tapioca flour.
4.  Combine the agar and remaining half cup of rejuvelac in a small saucepan.
5.  Whisk together and bring to a boil.
6.  Simmer for 3 to 4 minutes.
7.  Pour in the yogurt mixture and mix well with a whisk.
8.  Continue cooking over medium heat, stirring with a wooden spoon, until the mixture is smooth, glossy, and stretchy.
9.  Meanwhile, prepare a large bowl of ice water. Using an ice cream scooper or small spoon, drop balls of the cheese into the ice bath. I wasn't too worried about shape as I was intending to slice the cheese!

10. Let sit for 20 to 30 minutes until firm.
11. Store in the fridge in water (change water daily). Will last about 5 days.
