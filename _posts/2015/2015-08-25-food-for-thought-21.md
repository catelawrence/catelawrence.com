I&#8217;m a bit behind from blogging at the moment!



I&#8217;ve been seeing movies at the [Berlin Fantasy Film Festival](https://www.fantasyfilmfest.com/) (I recommend _Deathgasm_ for a laugh).



I&#8217;ve also been enjoying [_T__he Great British Bake-O__f__f_](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b013pqnm) and [_The Americans. _](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2149175/)

Always funny!

We went to the German Resistance Memorial Centre and also the [Topography of Terror](https://www.topographie.de/). I recommend both for a visit-both are free and very interesting. We are looking forward to [Lange Nacht der Museen](https://www.lange-nacht-der-museen.de/en/) this weekend. Although we won&#8217;t be there too late as we&#8217;re off to Prague on Sunday afternoon!

I also went swimming in Pankow, it&#8217;s a big lake but the free part was a bit muddy for my liking!

I&#8217;ve not been terribly busy with workshops the last couple of weeks but rather doing some (paid) writing work. I really enjoy teaching workshops but despite some of the ingredients being far more expensive than in Australia, classes run for a much lower fee here which makes it harder to make a profit. It&#8217;s the reality that everyone has to deal with when they decide to put on price on teaching their skills, how do I make them financially viable? This means factoring in the cost of ingredients, incidentals like power, water, etc and of course knowledge and time. If I teach a cheese making class for example, I have to buy ingredients, hand make cheeses and some of the other ingredients 1-2 weeks in advance before the class, determine which recipes will be taught, make and plan catering the day before the class, set up for the class, teach the class for 5 hours, pack up and clean up. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I don&#8217;t mind doing any of this, it&#8217;s just a bit frustrating when people then say that a class is too expensive (at a third of the cost of what I would teach it in Australia).  I&#8217;ve spoken to lots of people here who&#8217;ve been struggling with the same issue, it seems to be more apparent in Berlin than Melbourne as the cost of living is of course, much lower. At the moment, unless I have a large class, I can earn more writing an article as a freelancer than teaching a class. I&#8217;ve got a few ideas, but it&#8217;s a gradual process to get things right!

_ Things that have been capturing my interest: _
