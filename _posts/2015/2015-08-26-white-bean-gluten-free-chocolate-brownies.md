I've read quite a lot of recipes which use black beans as an alternative to flour in making brownies. I find the taste of black beans (and kidney beans) is too overpowering in baking from past experience so I used white (aka navy) beans instead. When you drain the beans, save the brine, you can use it to make vegan [meringues](https://atravellingcook.com/2015/05/egg-free-meringues.html) or [lemon butter](https://atravellingcook.com/2015/05/egg-free-lemon-butter.html) or even vegan [dumplings](https://atravellingcook.com/2015/08/egg-free-potato-dumplings.html)!

This recipe makes quite a squigy type of brownie that is fudgy and chocolately and good! They bake quite dark so they aren't the easiest to photograph but they are delicious.

_Ingredients:_

-   1 cups drained and rinsed white (navy) beans
-   1/4 cup strawberries, hulled
-   1/2 cup almonds, soaked in water for 4 hours
-   1/2 cup unsweetened cacao powder
-   1/2 cup sugar or agave
-   1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
-   1/2 teaspoon all spice
-   1 tablespoon golden syrup/sugar beet syrup/agave syrup
-   1/3 cup coconut oil
-   1 teaspoon vanilla essence/powder

_Instructions:_

1.  Preheat oven to 180 degrees celcius (350 degrees fahrenheit). Line a loaf tin with baking paper leaving some overhanging longer bits on the sides. These will make it easier to remove the brownies when they are cool.
2.  In a blender or food processor, puree the all of the ingredients, scraping down the sides and stirring regularly. Add a little water as needed as you are aiming for a smooth batter.
3.  Adjust the cacao and sugar as needed. I find this is often about personal taste!
4.  Stir well and spoon batter into the pan using a spatula or wooden spoon.
5.  Smooth over the top of the batter to be relatively even.
6.  Bake at 180 degrees for about 45-60 minutes. They may seem a bit soft in the middle but this is good as it means they will be fudgy when they cool.
7.  Cool completely in pan, then lift the whole brownie out by pulling up on the edges of the parchment paper.
8.  Transfer to a chopping board and slice using a very sharp knife.
