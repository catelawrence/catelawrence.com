I like to keep a lot what I call staples in my pantry for when I want something simple to cook that isn't pasta or toast. My staples include coconut milk, tinned vegetables and beans, rice, small jars of curry paste and miso paste ( I write more about this in my cookbook [Soups, salads and sides](https://sellfy.com/p/AnEq/)). I also keep potatoes, garlic, ginger and onions in the pantry and always frozen peas at least in the freezer! This makes it really easy to cook lots of different things without having to go shopping, especially on Sundays when supermarkets are closed. A lot of resources on saving money and reducing food waste rightly espouse batch cooking but the reality is, the food needs to be tasty or you won't want eat more than once! Having curry pastes, sauces, spices etc on hand at all times makes this a lot more easy.

This curry isn't exactly authentic but it is tasty!

-   1 tablespoon olive, coconut or peanut oil
-   1 red onion, diced
-   3 garlic cloves, minced
-   1/2 tablespoon ginger, minced
-   250 grams tofu, cut into chunks
-   3 cups mixed vegetables of choice diced (I used potatoes, tomatoes, celery, capsicum, mushrooms and peas)
-   3 tablespoon creamy peanut butter
-   1 tin light coconut milk
-   1 Tbsp Red Thai curry paste
-   1/2 teaspoon chlli powder (optional of course, I like hot food!)
-   spring onion for garnish
-   Heat oil on medium/high heat in a large fry pan Add the onion, garlic and ginger and cook, stirring constantly and until golden brown and fragrant, about 30 seconds.
-   Add the heavier vegetables (such as potatoes and carrots) and cook until they start to soften and lightly brown
-   Add the tofu and other vegetables
-   Add the peanut butter, coconut milk, curry paste and chilli powder and stir well. and lime juice into the pan and stir until the peanut butter melts and the everything is well mixed.
-   Bring the mixture to a boil, and cook for 5 minutes.
-   Then, reduce the heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens, and reduces by about half, about 15-20 minutes.
-   Whilst simmering put some rice or noodles onto boil.
-   Serve curry over rice topped with diced spring onions for garnish.
