Potato salad is something that is lovely if it's made well. This recipe uses some of my favourite ingredients: crunchy pickles, juicy baby peas, creamy avocado and chipotle chilli flakes. It's easy to put together and challenges the idea that potato salad has to be soaked with oil or full of cream, eggs or mayonnaise. You want to make the dressing just before serving to preserve the freshness of the avocado.

_Ingredients:_

-   1 kilogram potatoes
-   10 pickled cucumbers
-   2 spring onions diced
-   1/3 cup of baby peas, cooked

Dressing:

-   1 avocado, halved with skin and stone removed
-   1/3 cup cucumber pickle juice
-   1/2 teaspoon chipotle chilli flakes
-   1 tablespoon lemon juice
-   2 tablespoon fresh dill, finely chopped
-   2 tablespoons fresh mint, finely chopped
-   Salt and pepper to taste

_Instructions:_

1.  Halve and boil or steam potatoes until soft. Allow to cool
2.  Place in bowl
3.  Slice pickles and spring onions and add to potatoes
4.  Add baby peas

When ready to serve:

-   Mash avocado pear and stir in the remaining dressing ingredients
-   Gently mix through the salad and serve
