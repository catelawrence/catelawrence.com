I'm a big fan of making pies and pastries as my recipe ebook [_Australian Classics Veganised_](https://sellfy.com/p/2sEt/) will attest. These mushroom pies and quick and easy to make. I blend half the mixture to make a creamy soup type mix to contrast with the texture of the sliced mushrooms, meaning that the filling is thick and creamy without the need for cream.

_Ingredients_

-   1 tablespoon olive oil
-   1 red onion, diced
-   2 spring onions, diced
-   3 garlic cloves, finely diced
-   300grams white button mushrooms, sliced
-   300 grams chanterelle mushrooms, sliced
-   1/4 cup dairy free butter
-   1 tablespoon fresh parsley and thyme leaves
-   1/2 cup red wine
-   1/2 cup soy milk
-   salt and pepper to taste
-   2 sheets of frozen read made vegan puff pastry (most frozen puff pastry uses vegetable oils instead of butter)
-   Dairy free milk to brush the pastry lids
-   Sesame seeds

_Instructions:_

1.  Preheat oven to 180c
2.  Warm olive oil in a fry pan or saucepan.
3.  Fry onions and garlic for 2 minutes until translucent
4.  Add mushrooms, herbs and dairy free butter and cook until tender
5.  Add red wine and milk and cook until the liquid is reduced by at least half.
6.  Add salt and pepper to taste
7.  Remove half the mushrooms and sauce from the pan and blend in a blender.
8.  Allow to both the pan of mushrooms and those in the blender to cool
9.  Cut out pastry into circles of a size suitable to fit your muffin tins. You need two for each pie.
10. Press pastry into pie tins and top with the blended mushroom mix then the fresh mushrooms
11. Press the lids onto the pies and cut a small hole in the centre of each.
12. Brush with dairy free milk and sprinkle with sesame seeds.
13. Cook until the pastry is golden.

Apologies, my photo of the pies is not the best, I made them for dinner and it was a bit late by the time I got around to photographing them!
