Sausageless rolls are a bit of a tradition in Australia, along with meat pies. They are basically sausage meat encased in pastry to be served with a generous amount of tomato sauce (ketchup). I've memories of just how popular they are in Australia based on working in a bakery as a teenager.

We used to sell hundreds. Of course, all well as being made from indeterminate meat products, they are also woefully fattening. This vegan version is animal free of course and makes a fantastic snack for your next party, a quick lunch or as part of dinner served with mash and peas. They also work very nicely cold taken to work or to a picnic.

_Ingredients:_

-   1 onion
-   3 cloves garlic
-   1 carrot, grated
-   200 grams walnuts
-   1/2 cup quinoa
-   200g silken tofu
-   1 animal free 'beef' stock cube/stock powder
-   1 tbsp soy sauce
-   1 tbsp barbecue sauce
-   Salt and pepper to taste
-   4 frozen puﬀ pastry sheets
-   Dairy free milk for brushing pastry
-   Sesame seeds

_Instructions:_

1.  Bring quinoa and 1 cup of water to boil in a medium saucepan. Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer until most of the liquid has been absorbed and quinoa is tender, about 15 to 20 minutes.
2.  Fluﬀ with a fork and add to a mixing bowl.
3.  Place walnuts in a food processor until well crushed but not to powder. Place in the bowl.
4.  Process garlic, stock cube, onion and carrot in a blender until chopped in small pieces. Add to the bowl.
5.  Add tofu, sauces and salt and pepper.
6.  Mix well. It should resemble a soft mush.
7.  Preheat oven to 200 degrees celsius and place baking paper on a baking tray.
8.  Thaw out your puﬀ pastry and slice each sheet in half so that it makes two rectangles.
9.  Spoon the ﬁlling down the centre third of each pastry rectangle leaving a gap at each open sausage end for mixture to expand when cooked.
10. Lightly brush another third with dairy free milk and then roll the pastry, starting from the empty third and tucking it into the brushed third.
11. Slice the roll into the size you would like with at least a 2 centimetres gap between each roll on the baking tray.
12. Brush each roll with diary free milk and sprinkle with sesame seeds. place them on the baking tray.
13. Bake the rolls for about 20 minutes, until they're golden and ﬂaky.
