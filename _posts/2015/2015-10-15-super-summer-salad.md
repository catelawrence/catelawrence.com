-   1 capsicum, cored and diced
-   1 bunch radishes, finely sliced
-   1/2 cup basil leaves, washed and roughly chopped
-   1 cup baby tomatoes, halved
-   1 cucumber, diced
-   1 carrot, diced
-   1 cup walnuts, roughly chopped

Salad dressing:

-   1 garlic clove, finely diced
-   1/4 cup white wine vinegar
-   1 diced spring onion
-   2 tablespoons walnut oil
-   1 tablespoons agave syrup
-   1 tablespoon lemon juice
-   ½ teaspoon salt
-   ½ teaspoon black pepper
