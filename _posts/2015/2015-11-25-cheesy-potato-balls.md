This is a recipe I developed after I found myself with leftover mashed potatoes. Sure, you could deep fry them, but the mess of dealing with big pots of boiling oil, oil splatters and the like is something that I find less than appealing. It's a recipe that really gives you room to move. You can use different brands and flavours of vegan cheese, flavour your potatoes and bread crumbs with herbs or spices or event replace the bread crumbs with crushed cornflakes for a gluten free variation. I like to serve mine with homemade herbed mayonnaise and Srircha sauce with a squirt of lime, but mustard also works well.

_Ingredients_

-   6 large potatoes (about 600grams )
-   Olive oil spray
-   Salt and pepper to taste
-   125 grams butter
-   1 cup dairy free milk
-   1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
-   1/2 teaspoon onion powder
-   250 grams vegan cheese (block cheese or grated will work)
-   1 cup bread crumbs (make your own is placing dry bread in food processor or check labels carefully as some commercial brands contain fish oil) or very well crushed cornflakes.
-   Egg free mayonnaise, Srircha sauce, etc. to serve

_Instructions:_

1.  Peel and quarter the potatoes.
2.  Place in a medium saucepan.
3.  Cover with cold water and a sprinkle of salt salt and bring to a boil.
4.  Lower heat to medium and cook until tender, about 20 minutes.
5.  Meanwhile, preheat oven to 180c (350f) . Line a large baking sheet with baking paper and spray lightly with olive oil spray.
6.  When potatoes are done, drain well in a colander
7.  Return to the saucepan and add the butter, milk and garlic and onion powders and mash until smooth, adding the milk as needed-probably about 1/3 to 1/2 cup. It should be fairly thick, if not, pop it in the fridge for 15 minutes to firm up.
8.  If using block cheese, cut cheese into small cubes, about 2cm by 2cm (about 3/4 of an inch).
9.  Place bread crumbs on a plate or shallow bowl
10. Remove mashed potato from the fridge and shape it into ovals or balls using your hands.
11. Poke a hole in each ball and insert the cheese, making sure it is completely covered with a thick layer of potato.
12. Dip each potato ball into the rest of the milk then roll in bread crumbs.
13. Place them on the prepared baking tray.
14. Spray the potato balls with oliveoil spray. Bake 15 minutes or until hot and golden.
15. Serve immediately with a dipping sauce of your choice.
