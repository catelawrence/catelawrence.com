excerpt: Microsoft latest enterprise offering makes app creation easy.

![](rw-import/MTM0OTAzNTMwOTI5NTgyMDUw.png)

Can you picture your boss building an app? Just as anyone who wields
PowerPoint can create a logo, now anyone can build a business app,
thanks to Microsoft's
new [PowerApps](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/), a new
enterprise service to help workers create apps. 

Introduced last week at its annual [Convergence
MEA](https://news.microsoft.com/2015/11/30/microsoft-announces-solutions-to-help-businesses-modernize-in-the-digital-world/), Microsoft's
Software as a Service (SaaS) PowerApps can also connect to business
systems in a secure way and let employees share their apps with
coworkers. The service was hinted at in April of this year, thanks to a
leaked [job
posting](https://www.winbeta.org/news/microsoft-mistakenly-reveals-plans-power-apps-new-job-listing-1) seeking
developers to create mobile-first, cloud-based apps. 

The company's foray into business apps[ appears to be a
response](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2015/11/30/introducing-microsoft-powerapps/) to
what it cites as a lag in business apps at the expense of personal apps,
compounded by a lack of skilled developers, a confusion of business data
stored in a range of systems and difficulties getting apps onto employee
phones. 

Microsoft designed its app creator to be easy to use, and the apps
should work on any device using a Microsoft Office-like experience. 

Making Enterprise App-Creation Easy 
------------------------------------

Microsoft provides a highly pictorial drag and drop interface including
templates for building basic apps with a few clicks. The PowerApps can
be connected to cloud services like Office 365, Dynamics CRM,
Salesforce, Dropbox and OneDrive as well as on-premises systems like
SharePoint, SQL Server, Oracle databases, SAP and more. 

The apps are made available through the central PowerApps app on iOS,
Android and Windows Phone, as well as on the web. Sharing them with
co-workers is just a matter of sending a link to the app. 

PowerApps complements the infrastructure of Azure, since it enables
in-house developers to build data connections and APIs to existing
business systems. Developers can manage existing corporate APIs using
Azure Active Directory. 

Microsoft's interest in business apps is nothing unique, with companies
like Salesforce and Pipedrive already invested in the market. But its
brand recognition and good reputation holds it in good stead.
