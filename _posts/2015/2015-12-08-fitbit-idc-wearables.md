Fitbit wearable devices 

Quarterly figures released last week by [International Data
Corporation](https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS40674715) on
sales of wearable tracking devices showed that Fitbit held steady in
first position with 22% of the market. 

When the Apple Watch was first announced, we [expected it would cut into
the fitness-tracking
market](https://readwrite.com/2014/09/09/apple-watch-health-fitness).
Instead, the Apple Watch has mostly hurt other smartwatch makers, like
Samsung, which fell out of the top five this quarter.

Fitbit's success stems from a number of factors. Its retail distribution
is top-notch, and has been growing outside the US. Its latest trackers,
the Fitbit Charge and Fitbit Surge, are selling well. And its signing up
big sales to businesses that want to give fitness devices to their
employees—like Target, which is including 335,000 workers in Fitbit's
Corporate Wellness program.

The Apple Watch, meanwhile, is selling well, thanks to its relatively
more affordable Sport line. The release of WatchOS 2, which allows apps
to take better advantage of the smartwatch's built-in capabilities, may
increase interest.

mi bands by Xiaomi

[Xiaomi](https://www.mi.com/en/) comes in third and offers an interest
contrast to Apple. The company, best known as the top Android smartphone
maker in China, sells fitness bands for less than \$15. 

"China has quickly emerged as the fastest-growing wearables market,
attracting companies eager to compete on price and feature sets,"
wrote [Ramon
Llamas](https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=PRF002081), research
manager for IDC's
[wearables](https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=IDC_P29207)team,
in the report. But Chinese companies like Xiaomi have struggled to
extend their reach outside China. An example is fifth-place seller XTC,
producer of the Y01 children's phone watch.

Smaller companies hold 34% of the market, showing considerable
fragmentation. There isn’t a single Android Wear manufacturer in the top
five, [despite a slew of new releases this
year](https://readwrite.com/tag/android-wear), suggesting that Google's
smartwatch operating system just isn't taking off.

It seems like the real challenge for Fitbit isn't coming from makers of
other wrist-worn wearables. Instead, it's [the high drop-off
rates](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/wearables-have-a-dirty-little-secret-most-people-lose-interest/) seen
by fitness trackers. Corporate wellness programs, which sometimes offer
financial incentives to use the devices, might be an answer. For now,
winning a market where people stop using devices after less than a year
seems like a hollow prize.
