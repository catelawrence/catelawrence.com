This recipe is inspired by a Nigella Lawson recipe which I modified and used to teach at our Edible gifts workshop. I realised I hadn't shared it yet, so here goes:

**Chocolate salami**

_Ingredients_

-   200 g of sweet biscuits (gluten free are fine)
-   140 g of dairy free butter
-   100g dark chocolate
-   50 g of powdered cocoa
-   100 g chopped almonds/pistachios
-   6 dried figs chopped
-   120 g of sugar/80g agave powder
-   optional: 3 tablespoons of brandy liquor or cof­fee

_Instructions_

1.  Break the biscuits into small pieces, like big crumbs.
2.  In the same bowl, add sugar, nuts, cocoa and the butter (the latter slightly melted).
3.  Stir all ingredients together with a wooden spoon.
4.  Melt the chocolate and then add it to the bowl.
5.  Mix everything together
6.  Unroll and slice off 2 large pieces of cling film, overlapping them so that you have a large cling-cov­ered surface to roll the chocolate salami out on.
7.  Tip the chocolate mixture out in the middle of this and – using your hands, messy though this is – mould the mixture into a fat salami-like log, about 30cm long.
8.  Cover the chocolate log completely with the cling film, and then firmly roll it, as if it were a rolling pin, to create a smooth, rounded cylinder from the rough log you started with. Twist the ends by grasp­ing both ends of the cling film and rolling the sausage-log towards you several times.
9.  Put it in the fridge to set.
10. Decorate by rolling in icing sugar then tying with string to resemble store bought salami.
