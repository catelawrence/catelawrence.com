This week Facebook company [Parse](https://www.parse.com) announced the
launch of new Parse software development kits (SDKs) for [Apple’s
tvOS](https://developer.apple.com/tvos/) and[ watchOS
2](https://www.apple.com/watchos-2/), so Facebook developers can build
immersive apps for the Apple TV and the Apple Watch. 

Parse previously released support for the Apple Watch and App Extensions
in April, which enabled developers to build apps with extensions running
on Apple Watch alone—without having to rely on a constant connection to
an iPhone. More recently, the company announced the [open sourcing of
its SDKs](https://blog.parse.com/announcements/open-sourcing-our-sdks/)
in August. 

A major challenge  faced  by Parse was local storage with tvOS, and it
decided to re-architect local data persistence from the iOS SDK. 

In response to [the problem of logging into apps via
tvOS](https://readwrite.com/2015/12/03/twitter-digits-tvos) (difficult
without a regular keyboard), the Facebook integration library has been
updated to let users login to tvOS apps using the Facebook tvOS SDK by
using just a few lines of code. 

Both new SDKs, as well as the updated Facebook integration library are
available on GitHub.
