excerpt: Philips shut out third-party bulbs—then backed down.
---
Philips was forced to reverse recent software updates this week when it
was revealed that updates to its [Philips
Hue](https://www2.meethue.com/en-us/) wireless lighting system [cut off
access to previously supported light
bulbs](https://zatznotfunny.com/2015-12/philips-hue-excludes-3rd-party-bulbs/) made
by other companies.

Here's how Philips explained the decision:

> *While the Philips Hue system is based on open technologies we are not
> able to ensure all products from other brands are tested and fully
> interoperable with all of our software updates. For guaranteed
> compatibility you need to use Philips Hue or certified Friends of Hue
> products.*

Hue You Calling A "Friend"?
---------------------------

Philips has had a Friends of Hue program for partners, but until
recently, that was limited to Apple's HomeKit software for
connected-home devices and Nest's smart-home products. Philips [only
listed Philips-manufactured devices under the "Friends of Hue" section
on its
website](https://www.usa.philips.com/c-m-li/hue-personal-wireless-lighting/friends-of-hue/latest#filters=HUE_FRIENDS_SU&sliders=&support=&price=&priceBoxes=&page=&layout=12.subcategory.p-grid-icon).
 Last week, Philips announced Bosch, Logitech, and Samsung SmartThings
as partners.  All of their connected home products, applications, and
platforms will integrate with Philips Hue.

That invite-only approach clashes with the principles of the [ZigBee
alliance](https://www.zigbee.org/), a group promoting a networking
standard that [controls these smart lighting
systems](https://www.zigbee.org/what-is-zigbee/connectedlighting/). In
theory, Zigbee-compatible devices should work together.

Philips is rolling back the firmware updates that blocked access to
third-party bulbs, a move that should be completed by December 21. But
it seems like in the long term, Philips wants manufacturers to sign up
for Friends of Hue and get certified. That's a strategy that looks
similar to Apple's [MFi
program](https://developer.apple.com/programs/mfi/), which tightly
controls the devices that can work with iPods, iPhones, and iPads.

For smart-home device makers, the question will be whether to get in
line and go with Philips official certification program, skip that and
count on continued ZigBee support, or opt to support more open smart
lighting systems. If Philips' move chastens enough hardware developers,
it may find that Hue is left in the dark.
