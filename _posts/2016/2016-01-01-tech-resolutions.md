Most resolutions revolve around physical self-improvement—diet,
exercise, and the like. Why not take a breath and tend to your digital
health as well? Here are some ways to make your online life a little
more manageable, so you can take better care of your colleagues,
customers, and friends.

Use A Password Manager
----------------------

Every time there's a security breach we are warned [to choose new,
unique passwords for affected apps and
websites](https://readwrite.com/2014/05/06/lastpass-joe-siegrist-heartbleed-password-manager-privacy-security-builders).
If you're not gifted with an eidetic memory, good luck remembering them
all. Password managers can store passwords for your email, banking
accounts and social sites like Facebook and
Twitter. [LastPass](https://lastpass.com/) and
[LogMeOnce](https://www.logmeonce.com/) are a couple of good options.

Unplug Your Screens
-------------------

When you're passionate about your work, it's easy to spend a good chunk
of the day in contact with a screen or electronic device. We won't judge
you if you spend all day in front of a screen, go home and eat dinner in
front of Netflix, and finish by reading an ebook in bed, it's great for
your body and mind to shake it up. Grow some plants, take a cooking
class, visit museums and flea markets, go bike riding, play board games,
and cultivate other screen-free interests. Bonus points if you can power
down your phone while you're at it.

Unplugging is hard, so start with a simple resolution, like avoiding
social media an hour before bedtime.

Commit To Showing Up
--------------------

Are you one of those people who RSVP "yes" to every tech meetup and
Facebook invite but fail to attend? Being a no-show just to ease your
[FOMO](https://www.slate.com/blogs/quora/2015/09/30/fomo_what_s_the_psychology_behind_the_fear_of_missing_out.html) isn't
just rude. It can [impact the ability for
others](https://blog.thefetch.com/2013/08/03/the-golden-rules-of-meetup-etiquette/)
to attend and for organizers to cater appropriately. Use a calendar app
to plan your time and don't overcommit.

Once you do show up, be present. It's easy to spot newbies standing
alone. Don't leave them standing there. Introduce yourself and invite
them to join your small group or introduce them to others. Networking is
not just about what you get out of it but what you can offer also. 

Contribute To The Community 
----------------------------

in Sydney, Australia

Tech folks are generally a benevolent bunch. Whether helping paint a new
coworking space or running meetup groups for love not money, people in
the startup scene is generous with their time and money. If you would
like to get on board, think about how you can help and commit to
concrete actions like [helping
refugees](https://readwrite.com/2015/12/11/tech-refugees-aid-organizations),
employing [traditionally disadvantaged folk](https://www.code2040.org/)
in your workplace, or instituting a workplace scheme where staff can
receive time off to work on volunteer projects. 

Keep Your Devices Clean
-----------------------

If you've ever had to get sticky milk or melted chocolate from in
between keyboard keys, you'll you'll know the pain of a dirty
laptop. After spilling red wine on my laptop, I now have a rule against
drinking and typing to avoid a repeat performance. Buy a keyboard
protector for a handful of change, invest in a laptop bag or cover, and
clean your device regularly. Don't forget your mouse, smartphone screen,
and headphones. 

Change Your Workplace 
----------------------

![](rw-import/MTM1NTMwMDY1NzI2MzEzNzQ2-2.jpg)\

A change of location can be a great way to revitalize your working week,
especially if you don't have a traditional office. Try a [coworking
space](https://coworkingmap.org/), library, or coffee shop. To stay in
touch with your colleagues, look at reducing time reading and writing
emails and explore options like [Slack](https://slack.com/), [Google
Hangouts](https://hangouts.google.com/), and
[Sqwiggle](https://www.sqwiggle.com/). Team chat software builds
stronger bonds, while email piling up feels like a chore.

If you do have an office and don't have flexible arrangements, give
yourself the opportunity to explore your neighborhood in your lunch
hour. Try 5 minutes of stretching for each hour of sitting or a quick
walk before work each day.

Have Fun With Colleagues

Most of us spend more time with our colleagues than our families and
friends. Yet it's easy to fall into a trap where your only downtime
involves alcohol after work, a boring routine that can leave you worse
for wear the next morning. It's true some people don't like to socialize
with their colleagues, but I recommend getting to know the people I work
with.  Ask around for suggestions. Go for a picnic, bring some board
games into work, start a book club, or have a weekly brown bag lunch
together outside of the office. 

Keep Your Resume Updated
------------------------

The tech industry moves fast. It's also one of the few sectors that is
always hiring. Keep your industry knowledge current by attending
training courses and conferences. Research companies that you might like
to work for in the future and don't limit yourself to your country of
residence—most tech jobs are easily transferable internationally. If you
haven't looked at your resume since you started your current job, it's
not a bad idea to have a look at it with a fresh eye. 

Think About Your Digital Legacy
-------------------------------

![](rw-import/MTM1NTI5MjM0MTEzMjQzNzc5-2.jpg)\

No one wants to think of their own mortality, but it's inevitable. Do
you really want your mother who calls the Internet "The Google" to
figure out what to do with your email and social media accounts? It's no
joking matter—one famous online writer, Leslie Harpold, [had her sites
disappear after her family decided to let them
expire](https://workbench.cadenhead.org/news/3579/why-leslie-harpolds-sites-disappeared).
Facebook has a [legacy
option](https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2015/02/adding-a-legacy-contact/)
where you can nominate a friend to manage your account upon your death,
while [Twitter](https://support.twitter.com/forms/privacy) requires a
person authorized to access them on behalf of your estate or an
immediate family member to contact them directly.

 Then of course there's your email accounts, and retail accounts like
Apple's iTunes, Amazon, and eBay and probably a handful more that you
use every that you never thought you'd ever cancel. Fortunately, there's
a suit of services that can help you with everything from managing your
digital accounts to donating your online music library to a loved one. 

While you're contemplating the afterlife, it's a great time to also take
a few minutes to register for [organ donation](https://organize.org/).

Resolved: Let's All Do Better
-----------------------------

It's hard to change established habits and practices. I'm going to try
to avoid using my mobile phone in bed, and I plan on sitting out on the
balcony more often rather than in front of my heater. Now you tell me:
What are your intentions for 2016?
