excerpt: Technical obstacles for smart butlers.
---
On Sunday night, Facebook founder  Mark Zuckerberg announced his plans
for 2016 on his [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/zuck?fref=ts).
The task: build an artificially intelligent smart home.

> My personal challenge for 2016 is to build a simple AI to run my home
> and help me with my work. You can think of it kind of like Jarvis in
> Iron Man. I'm going to start by exploring what technology is already
> out there. Then I'll start teaching it to understand my voice to
> control everything in our home—music, lights, temperature, and so on.

Zuckerberg's ambitions go beyond standard smart-home features to include
supervision of his newborn daughter and facial recognition to let in
visiting friends.  He also hopes his efforts will enable him
to  visualize data in virtual reality.

The tech billionaire said a part of the motivation behind this year's
challenge was the reward of building things with his own hands.
Zuckerberg has lamented that it's been a long time since he got to touch
code at Facebook. Exploring artificial intelligence will help him
connect better with the AI scientists [Facebook is snapping up around
the globe](https://readwrite.com/2015/06/02/facebook-ai-research-paris).

A Smart Guy Is About To Meet The Not-So-Smart Home

We applaud Zuckerberg's ambitions here. But we think he's going to run
into trouble, because the application programming interfaces and
software-development kits behind most smart-home products available
today are immature and limited. "Developer preview" is just a nice way
of saying "Don't call us if your software breaks."

While there have been many announcements in the industry, few developers
have really put these APIs through their paces. Zuckerberg's
high-profile promise could be the accelerant that forces companies to
really test and improve their smart-home developer tools.

[Amazon Echo](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-SK705DI-Echo/dp/B00X4WHP5E),
a voice-activated speaker, might be a place to start. There, Zuckerberg
can use Amazon's Alexa Voice Service. It was [announced last
July](https://readwrite.com/2015/07/31/amazon-alexa-voice-service-developer-preview-echo)
and is—you guessed it—[still in "developer
preview."](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-voice-service)

Then of course there's [Wink](https://www.wink.com/about/)and its
wall-mounted touchscreen home automation service for lighting, home
security, temperature control, and so on. Its API—[which has changed
since its initial launch, breaking older applications built on
it](https://docs.winkapiv2.apiary.io/#)—has some interesting concepts,
like Robots for automated tasks, which Zuckerberg might explore. Wink
was recently sold out of bankruptcy to Flextronics, so it seems like a
safe bet to build on.

Some of what Zuckerberg aims to do may be available off the shelf, or he
might be able to automate some tasks using tools
like [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) or
Zapier. [Doorbird](https://www.doorbird.com/) might be an option for
front-door facial recognition. The only question there will be what
Zuckerberg will use for a database. Before [Facebook bought Face.com in
2012](https://readwrite.com/2012/05/30/facebooks-acquisition-of-facecom-gives-a-new-look-to-search),
that startup offered a facial-recognition API. It will be intriguing to
see if Zuckerberg uses a private Facebook API or [opts for one of the
newer
services](https://blog.mashape.com/list-of-10-face-detection-recognition-apis/).

Were really curious how Zuckerberg will implement AI [robot
childcare](https://www.washington.edu/news/2012/04/05/children-perceive-humanoid-robot-as-emotional-moral-being/).
Perhaps he'll take inspiration from Neal Stephenson's science-fiction
novel *[The Diamond
Age](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/827.The_Diamond_Age)*, in which
a young girl is raised by an artificially intelligent e-book.

Ultimately the biggest challenge may well be cajoling devices to
communicate with each other. Even when this is theoretically possible,
glitches often turn up, because the creators of smart-home APIs haven't
tested all the possible combinations of devices they might encounter.
 This could prove far more frustrating than creating the smart-home AI.
What good is a smart butler who just says, "I'm sorry, Mark, I can't do
that"?
