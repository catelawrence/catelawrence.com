excerpt: Distributed ledgers have more applications than finance.
---
A few years ago, Bitcoin, the distributed digital currency, was the
hottest thing to roll through the intersection of finance and
technology. It gained significant interest amongst those keen to create
a peer-to-peer, cashless currency.

But its attempt to enter the mainstream has been marred by reports
of [thefts](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-silkroad-agent-idUSKCN0R027F20150831),
[poor
marketing](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/03/bitcoin-2015-make-or-break-year), and
a general lack of comprehension by the general populace.

That's too bad, because Bitcoin is really just one application of a much
broader technology: the distributed ledger known as the blockchain. And
fortunately, people are beginning to understand the blockchain as a
phenomenon distinct from Bitcoin specifically and digital currency in
general.

The blockchain's strength lies in how it decentralizes transactions of
all sorts, allowing all kinds of digital assets to be safely and
permanently exchanged. It also promises the potential to create records
that can't be erased by attacking some central store of data. Because of
the features, the blockchain possesses the potential to increase
security and accountability in a range of industries.

Here are just a few new ways the blockchain is being used. Some may
surprise you.

The Art Of The Blockchain
-------------------------

![](rw-import/MTM1NjY2Mzk3NjUxOTY2NDMw-2.gif)\

['Balloon Dog Deflated' by Michael
Green](https://www.buro247.com/me/culture/news/worlds-mostexpensive-gif.html)

Digital artwork, which can include soundscapes, augmented reality, GIFs,
and pixel art, is growing and diversifying as a medium. You can even buy
recordings of brainwaves. Yet complications can arise when artists
attempt to sell digital art—or even distinguish it as theirs. As Douglas
Davis [wrote in his 1991
essay](https://classes.dma.ucla.edu/Winter09/9-1/_pdf/3-Davis_Work_of_Art.pdf)
"The Work Of Art In The Age of Digital Reproduction":

> The fictions of "master" and "copy" are now so entwined with each
> other that it is impossible to say where one begins and the other
> ends.

Davis, sadly, passed away two years ago. But surely someone should
attempt to write "The Work Of Art In The Age Of The Blockchain."

In Davis's era, the authenticity of digital art was difficult to verify.
Was a file an "original" or one of an edition? In contrast to the
conventions established in Walter Benjamin's age of "mechanical
reproduction," what did those terms even mean?

Companies like Berlin's [Ascribe](https://www.ascribe.io/) and New
York's [Monegraph](https://monegraph.com/index.html) are using
a [blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_chain_(database)) to
log each transfer of a work (just as a similar blockchain does for
bitcoins), so art ownership at any time cannot be disputed. Digital art
can be transferred, consigned, or loaned without losing attribution. The
location of the work throughout the internet can also be recorded to
document its history.

We won't begin to address the cultural issues that Benjamin and Davis's
essays raise with respect to this use of technology, but they're
interesting to think about, too.

The Potchain
------------

Although legal in a handful of US states, marijuana's use, sale, and
possession is still illegal under federal law. The buying and selling of
marijuana is difficult to navigate for both retailers and consumers.
It's primarily a cash-based industry, as banks
fear [prosecution](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/13/banks-marijuana-businesses_n_7057138.html) for
handling the funds.

While there are a number of bitcoin-based services like
[Potcoin](https://www.potcoin.com/), only recently has another option
become available. [Serica](https://www.sericapay.com/) uses the
blockchain to track and record every purchase of medical marijuana, and
gives companies an easy way to accept payment online. The startup has
already [signed a deal with the second largest e-commerce site for
medical
cannabis](https://www.entrepreneur-ideas.org/pot-startups-and-marijuana-angel-investors-are-growing-fast/#.Vo04DJMrJE4)
to become its sole online payment option.

Music That's Off The Blockchain
-------------------------------

![](rw-import/MTM1NjcwNTAyODM1NDA2ODU4-2.png)

In October, Ujo Music released a[ prototype
service](https://alpha.ujomusic.com/#/imogen_heap/tiny_human/tiny_human) featuring
a downloadable single by artist Imogen Heap. It was a practical
example of how a blockchain-based music industry might function.

Creators and rights holders register works and their stakes in those
works on the blockchain, and payments are delivered automatically and
instantly using smart contract technology. Artists may also publish
policies for how their music may be used, facilitating an open
marketplace in which anybody can innovate a new business model, app or
service as long as they meet the terms of those policies.

Currently, payments can be only made via bitcoin but credit-card support
is on the way. Beyond its initial announcement, the people behind the
Ujo project have been rather quiet.

Ad-free streaming service and marketplace
[Peertracks](https://peertracks.com/index.html) is still in the early
stages but is attracting interest. PeerTracks allows tipping,
patronage-style support, and even the buying and trading of
limited-edition, tradable VIP passes for artists, using blockchain
technology to track their transfer.

In this instance, the blockchain  serves as a global database for
copyrights, a means of payment for all music-related transactions.  It
also provides artists with transparent accounting, automatically split
up royalty payments and the capability to create their Notes so they can
get discovered and engage their fan bases. Fans can interact,
participate and even benefit from the success of their favorite artists.
Peertracks' beta launch is planned for the [first quarter of
2016](https://coinreport.net/conversation-cedric-cobban-co-founder-peertracks/).

The Blockchain Shall Rule
-------------------------

In May last year, the Isle of Man began the first government-run
blockchain project, using the blockchain to create a registry of
digital-currency companies operating on the island.  This was intended
to  stop money laundering, prevent terrorist financing, and aid
international trade sanctions, as financial flows could be traced
definitively to the specific individual involved.

Honduras has also turned to the blockchain with the help of a US
company, [Factom, ](https://factom.org/)as a mean to end [land-title
fraud](https://blog.factom.org/post/119366700609/honduras-to-build-land-title-registry-using?is_related_post=1)[. ](https://www.coinfox.info/news/2052-honduras-will-use-blockchain-to-build-a-secure-land-title-record-system)

“In the past, Honduras has struggled with land title fraud,” said Peter
Kirby, Factom's president. “The country’s database was basically hacked.
So bureaucrats could get in there and they could get themselves
beachfront properties.”

Factom's system includes verified timestamps and provides a distributed
mechanism to lock in data, making it independently auditable. However
the project has not been completed in its expected time frame.
[Updates](https://blog.factom.org/post/135920051224/a-humble-update-on-the-honduras-title-project)
describe a project that's encountering political delays despite support
from figures high up in the government.

Despite the obstacles in Honduras, Factom is continuing its work in land
titles, currently working with [BitSapphire](https://bitsapphire.com/)
on an anticorruption tool to manage the land municipal registry
databases in Kosovo. They plan to use the Factom API to build a
cryptographic record to prove the databases haven’t been corrupted.

Open Ledgers For Everyone
-------------------------

The Linux Foundation recently announced a new, collaborative [Open
Ledger](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/news-media/announcements/2015/12/linux-foundation-unites-industry-leaders-advance-blockchain) project
to advance blockchain technology, teaming with tech firms such as IBM
and Intel, the London Stock Exchange Group and big banks such as JP
Morgan, Wells Fargo, and State Street. Their aim is to advance
blockchain technology and:

> ... develop an enterprise grade, open source distributed ledger
> framework and free developers to focus on building robust,
> industry-specific applications, platforms and hardware systems to
> support business transactions.

The collaboration is intended to create cross-industry open standards to
transform business transactions. That banking and financial trading
services have come on board demonstrates the appeal of the blockchain
even to traditionally conservative industries.

The blockchain has not fully come into its full potential by any means.
Most projects seem to be in early stages of beta testing and trials. Yet
it's clear there are advances on an almost daily basis. It will be
interesting to see the outcomes of the Open Ledger project and what the
future holds for the blockchain, especially in newer applications like
[voting](https://www.ambisafe.co/egov/)and
[healthcare](https://insidebitcoins.com/news/tierion-and-philips-bring-blockchain-technology-to-healthcare-sector/35494).
While the technology will progress quickly, it's not as clear that our
political systems and everyday users will be able to keep up.

It won't be bits that hold back the blockhain, in other words. It will
be us humans.
