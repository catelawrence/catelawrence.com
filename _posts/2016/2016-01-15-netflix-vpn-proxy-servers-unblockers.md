Netflix announced [earlier this
week ](https://media.netflix.com/en/company-blog/evolving-proxy-detection-as-a-global-service)that any
subscribers using a virtual private network (VPN), proxy, or "unblocker"
service to access a version of Netflix that is not the one based in
their country of location  will be bounced over to their local service
in the next few weeks.

The move comes just after Netflix announced it was [launching service in
130 new
countries](https://www.cnet.com/au/news/netflix-goes-live-in-130-new-countries/)—a
response to the massive international demand for the service fulfilled,
so far, through the very services Netflix is now seeking to shut down. 

It's a decision that will be felt keenly by those who wish to watch
television shows and films outside of their region. Netflix may be an
international brand, now, but most films and TV shows remain subject to
regional licensing. That means, for example, that people living in the
UK will not be able to watch [*The Walking
Dead*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1520211/) and people in Australia
cannot watch *[How To Get Away With
Murder](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3205802/). *

Netflix’s terms of service haven’t changed. The company has long
explicitly forbidden the use of mechanisms to bypass its software that
detects a user's location, but it's never been strongly enforced up
until now. Netflix admits: 

> If all of our content were globally available, there wouldn’t be a
> reason for members to use proxies or “unblockers” to fool our systems
> into thinking they’re in a different country than they’re actually in.
> We are making progress in licensing content across the world and, as
> of last week, now offer the Netflix service in 190 countries, but we
> have a ways to go before we can offer people the same films and TV
> series everywhere.

Expatriatess in particular, who are a cohort that regularly use VPNs for
watching Netflix. I am an expat living in Germany where almost all
international films and television are dubbed *auf Deutsch*. While I am
happy to watch American films with German dubbing, despite my
less-than-stellar language skills,  it is nice to have the opportunity
to watch the original version. (Musicals are particularly bizarre when
dubbed.) 

My friends think the same, even the German ones. One friend claimed that
there are a small number of German actors who do all the voice overs so
a lot of characters across the media sound the same. A Reddit user
[claimed](https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/3czljq/do_most_germans_prefer_dubbed_movies_and_tv/ct0qwka)
that the same voice actor subs in for both Bryan Cranston in *Breaking
Bad* and Malcolm from *Malcolm In The Middle*. 

I contacted a VPN provider for comment, who said his company "preferred
to monitor the debate from the sideline" and asked not to be named.

Will the VPN services be able to bypass Netflix's new security
maneuvers? Obviously they cannot encourage their subscribers to engage
in what could be considered technically illegal acts. But if it turns
out Netflix is targeting specific providers, then something
like [building your own Raspberry Pi
VPN](https://readwrite.com/2014/04/10/raspberry-pi-vpn-tutorial-server-secure-web-browsing) server
could come in handy, provided you don't mind shelling out a little money
for hardware and spending some time coding. It will be far harder for
Netflix to deal with a distributed army of VPNs than to crack down on
specific, easily singled-out companies.

At least Netflix recognizes that people want to watch the same media all
over. I suspect this move is more meant to appease the Hollywood studios
that provide it with movies and shows. In the meantime, expect a
cat-and-mouse game with VPNs.
