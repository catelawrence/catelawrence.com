When Netscape [released its Web browser's source code to the public in
1998](https://www.cnet.com/news/netscape-sets-source-code-free/), it
seemed like a Hail Mary move for a company embattled by Microsoft.

Now barely a week goes by without a commercial tech company announcing
the launch of a new platform, app or extension—and its source code.
Among them is Microsoft, a company whose then-CEO, Steve Ballmer,
[called the open-source Linux operating system a "cancer" in
2001](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2001/06/02/ballmer_linux_is_a_cancer/).

In the last year we've seen Apple release the code behind
the [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) programming language;
Google, [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), a machine-learning
framework; Microsoft, a JavaScript
[engine](https://github.com/Microsoft/ChakraCore/wiki/Roadmap);* *and
Facebook, a plethora of open-source projects including* *[React
Native](https://code.facebook.com/projects/450791118411445/react-native/) and
[Relay](https://facebook.github.io/relay/).

The emergence of companies like Facebook, Airbnb, and Square, whose
businesses lie outside the world of commercial software, as players in
open source is particularly interesting. While they may follow the
[principles](https://opensource.org/docs/osd) that underpin traditional
open source software like [Linux](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/), the
reasons for their openness are not simply altruism and the greater good.

Releasing open source boosts their image as innovators, helping them
recruit engineers. It also helps create de facto standards, as startups
adopt their way of writing code. And in some cases, it may accelerate
the development of entire industries.

Here are the big-picture trends that are driving open source forward in
2016—and beyond.

Open Source Creates New Industries
----------------------------------

![](rw-import/MTM1ODA5MDE2NjA0NDA0MzU1.jpg)\

Tesla Motors

In 2014, Tesla Motors, the electric-car maker,[ gave away its
entire patent
portfolio](https://readwrite.com/2014/06/16/what-apple-should-learn-from-tesla),
providing those using it promised not to engage in courtroom battles
over intellectual property. While [General Motors rebuffed Tesla's
offer](https://gmauthority.com/blog/2015/02/general-motors-not-interested-in-open-tesla-patents/),
the potential consequences of this are an increase in electric-car
innovation across the automotive industry, meaning more electric cars,
more infrastructure for them, and more consumers interested in buying
them—including from Tesla. 

Open Source Will Make Machines Smarter
--------------------------------------

Likewise, in [November Google launched
TensorFlow](https://googleblog.blogspot.de/2015/11/tensorflow-smarter-machine-learning-for.html),
an [open-­source platform for machine
learning](https://www.tensorflow.org/). TensorFlow was originally
developed by researchers and engineers working on the Google Brain team
conducting machine learning and deep neural-networks research. The core
is written in C++, but it has a Python front end. 

By involving open-source enthusiasts, Google believes it will bring
artificial intelligence closer to reality. Outsiders may expand the tool
to other languages, including
[Go](https://www.wired.com/2015/08/googles-house-programming-language-now-runs-phones/),
[Java](https://www.wired.com/2013/09/the-second-coming-of-java/), and
perhaps even [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), so
that coders have more ways of building AI-driven apps. 

In a similar area, Tesla CEO Elon Musk and a team of experts in open
machine learning recently announced the creation of a billion-dollar
not-for-profit company artificial research company, [Open
AI](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-openai/):

> As a nonprofit, our aim is to build value for everyone rather than
> shareholders. Researchers will be strongly encouraged to publish their
> work, whether as papers, blog posts, or code, and our patents (if any)
> will be shared with the world. We'll freely collaborate with others
> across many institutions and expect to work with companies to research
> and deploy new technologies.

Machine learning is a hard problem, made easier if advancements in the
field are shared.

Open Source Makes Coders Happy 

The altruistic notion of coders inspecting open source projects to fix
bugs and add features dominates the image of open source. But reality is
more complicated.

A programmer's GitHub page has become a de facto résumé. By contributing
to open-source projects, a coder can show off her chops and impress
recruiters and hiring managers—without the trouble of an awkward
interview.

As Tom Preston-Werner, cofounder of GitHub, [put
it](https://tom.preston-werner.com/2011/11/22/open-source-everything.html):

> If you're hiring, the best technical interview possible is the one you
> don't have to do because the candidate is already kicking ass on one
> of your open source projects. Once technical excellence has been
> established in this way, all that remains is to verify cultural fit
> and convince that person to come work for you.

It also has other professional and social benefits. One's open-source
contributions instantly explain one's interests, serving as a calling
card. Want to find a collaborator to work on a project? Just chat up
someone who's building up the same codebase as you. For Alvaro Videla,
contributing to RabbitMQ, an application messaging broker, [led to
writing a book and getting invited to speak at
conferences](https://videlalvaro.github.io/2014/08/on-contributing-to-opensource.html).

Open source isn't an unalloyed good. There are downsides for both coders
and companies who participate in projects, which I'll address in future
pieces. But it's clear that the powerful driving forces that have placed
open source at the center of software innovation will continue
throughout this year—and for years to come.
