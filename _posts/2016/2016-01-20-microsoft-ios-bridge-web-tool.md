excerpt: A port in a storm?

We haven't heard much from Path, a social app, since Korean Internet
company Daum Kakao bought it last year. But a recent tweet caught our
eye:

**Path, which still has many users in Southeast Asia, has abandoned the
Windows Phone platform. So, too, for that matter, has Microsoft. It is
[moving on from its transitional mobile operating
system](https://www.theverge.com/2015/7/8/8913365/microsoft-lumia-windows-phones-strategy-2015)
to going all-in on Windows 10, which is meant to run on devices from
traditional PCs to smartphones.

In the meantime, Microsoft has a problem: Developers are betting on iOS
and Android, since that's where the mobile users are. Windows 10
smartphones are just now rolling out, and they're getting dinged for a
lack of apps.

A Bridge To Windows
-------------------

So Microsoft has been hard at work on solutions to get mobile developers
to bring their existing code to Windows 10 without the need to write new
apps from scratch on an unfamiliar platform. Its strategy: Create a
series of “bridging” technologies to enable developers to bring their
existing iOS, Android, Web, and desktop code and skill sets to the
Windows Store, which is meant to be a universal app-delivery platform
for desktop and mobile.

Microsoft first detailed the Windows bridge for iOS, formerly known as
Project Islandwood, on the [Windows blog in August
2015](https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2015/08/06/open-sourcing-the-windows-bridge-for-ios/),
when it released it as an open-source "work in progress" toolkit for
developers. Source code and instructions for the iOS bridge for Windows
10 were made available in
[GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/WinObjC).

Now Microsoft has announced it will soon release a [Web
tool](https://dev.windows.com/en-us/bridges/ios/app-submission) that
will:

> "... automatically analyze your app for compatibility with the bridge
> and give you results right in your browser. You’ll be able to see
> exactly how much work you’ll have to do to bring your app to Windows,
> along with suggestions, tips and workarounds for any libraries you’re
> using that the bridge doesn’t support yet."

Microsoft is still struggling to build some of its bridges. In November,
the [Android
bridge](https://tempest.saymedia.com/Microsoft%20also%20developed%20a%20Web%20bridge%20for%20Windows%2010%20(%22Westminster%22)%20and%20is%20working%20on%20a%20bridge%20to%20help%20developers%20package%20and%20publish%20existing%20.NET%20and%20Win32%20apps%20to%20the%20Windows%20Store%20(%22Centennial%22).%20Microsoft%20partner%20Mobilize.Net%20also%20developed%20a%20bridge%20to%20help%20Windows%20Phone%20Silverlight%20apps%20to%20the%20Universal%20Web%20Apps%20platform.),
also known as ** Project Astoria, was apparently[put on
hold](https://www.gsmarena.com/microsoft_confirms_that_android_app_support_in_windows_10_is_on_hold-news-15053.php).

In better shape are a Web bridge for Windows 10, [Project
Westminster](https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2015/07/06/project-westminster-in-a-nutshell/),
as well as bridges for its existing developers writing .NET and Win32
apps ([Project
Centennial](https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2015/08/06/open-sourcing-the-windows-bridge-for-ios/)),
with public testing sometime this year.

The irony is that for much of the '90s and the early 2000s, Windows was
the build-first platform, and other operating systems had to build
porting tools, like the Windows-to-Linux Mono project. Now the shoe is
on the other foot—and Microsoft is finding that porting is a hard task,
indeed.
