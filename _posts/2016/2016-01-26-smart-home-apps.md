excerpt: The software doesn't live up to the hardware
---
Consumers are frustrated with smart homes. Notably, they're not annoyed
with the devices that wire up their living environments. It's the apps
through which they schedule and manage each device, according to a new
report from [Argus Insights](https://www.argusinsights.com/).  

Argus, notably, uses actual data drawn from devices and public sources
like app-store reviews. In this case, it analyzed 50,000 smart-home
device and app reviews from August 2015 to the present.
Researchers found that there is a profound disconnect between how
consumers perceive the hardware and software produced by several major
smart-home brands.

Industry stalwart
[Honeywell's](https://readwrite.com/2014/06/11/honeywell-and-vivints-new-smart-home-platforms-openness-is-overrated)
apps received the best ratings despite their low-rated devices. By
comparison, apps
from [Philip ](https://readwrite.com/2014/03/31/smart-lightbulbs-smart-home-philips-hue-lg-samsung)apps
were considered the least satisfactory, though their physical products
faired better.

A Slow App Is Not Smart
-----------------------

![](rw-import/MTM2MTMzMTgwMzM0ODExNzc5.png)

Users  often complained of “major delays” and generally “slow” and
“unresponsive” interfaces. One major pain point persists around video
streaming, with reports of videos going “black every few seconds” and
“extremely long” load times when attempting to view content through
applications. 

One big reason for dissatisfaction is that consumers don't have a choice
in most cases: In order to use the device, they're forced to download
the manufacturer's app. This is a big argument in support of [smart-home
hub developers like
Wink](https://readwrite.com/2014/09/23/wink-relay-touchscreen-wall-panel).
Wink CTO Nathan Smith recently told ReadWrite that Wink is deemphasizing
its physical touchscreen hub in favor of its apps that can handle many
major smart-home brands, and its recently announced support for Amazon
Echo.

Make Better Apps—Or Get Out Of The Way
--------------------------------------

There is an inherent bias to data drawn from consumer-posted reviews, as
consumers are more likely to post reviews of products when they
experience problems. Yet two things stand out from the report:

-   Consumers are resigned, not receptive, to using apps to manage their
    smart-home devices. Manufacturers have largely failed to create
    captivating experiences.
-   Overall, most app experiences fail to match up with that of the
    hardware devices. 

This study is a wake-up call to companies in the smart-home space: You
can't think of yourself as just a hardware company anymore. You're an
app developer, too.

And if you discover you're not a very good app developer? Then you'd be
best off opening up an API and letting others build better apps for you.
