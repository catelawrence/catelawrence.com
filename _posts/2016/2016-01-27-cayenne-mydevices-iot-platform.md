Everyone from
[Facebook](https://readwrite.com/2015/09/03/parse-facebook-iot-sdk) to
[Google](https://readwrite.com/2015/05/28/android-studio-1-3-google-iot-smart-homes-brillo-weave) to
Salesforce is trying to make it easier to build software for the
Internet of Things, the catch-all term that's come to embrace a wide
variety of connected devices in our homes, on our bodies, and around the
towns and cities where we live.

Into this scrum came [MyDevices](https://www.mydevices.com/), a Los
Angeles-based company, which
unveiled [Cayenne](https://www.cayenne-mydevices.com/), a set of
software tools for IoT developers and makers.

Kevin Bromber, the CEO of MyDevices, claims Cayenne will make IoT
project development fast and accessible—so that a simple project can be
created in as little as 15 minutes. 

Bromber acknowledged the competition for developers' attentions, telling
me:

>  “There are a lot of IoT platforms on the market, yet there are few
> IoT platforms that actually let the developer build a project without
> having to dig deep into SDKs and APIs just to get a simple proof of
> concept created.”

Where Cayenne hopes to speed things up is through automatic device and
sensor discovery. It provides drag-and-drop widgets that let the
developer easily visualize real-time and historical data and triggers
that allow a sensor, motor, or actuator to invoke an action on another
device. There are also threshold alerts that send emails or SMS messages
based on customizable criteria, and provisions for scheduling specific
days and times when lights, motors, valves, and actuators turn on and
off.

“It is like an easy-to-use website builder but for IoT projects,”
Bromber said.

Cayenne's support for [Raspberry
Pi](https://readwrite.com/2014/11/10/raspberry-pi-releases-model-a-plus) could
make it popular with tinkerers who like that cheap hardware platform for
simple projects and prototypes. Here's a

how to set your first Cayenne project up:
