excerpt: Lyft and other partners already onboard
---
Popular navigation app Waze has introduced a transport SDK (software
development kit) to enable third party developers to integrate Waze
features into their own apps. Waze is a community-based traffic and
navigation app that is owned by Google and services over 50 million
consumers.

The SDK is capable of supporting partners in countries where Waze has a
presence and will be open to all types of partners including such as
food delivery, taxis and valet parking. The first set of partners
announced are [Lyft](https://lyft.com/), [Genesis
Pulse](https://genesispulse.com/),[JustPark](https://www.justpark.com/),
[Cornershop](https://cornershopapp.com/),
[Cabify](https://www.cabify.es/es/home) and
[99Taxis](https://www.99taxis.com/). Using the SDK, the partner will be
able to utilize Waze’s ETA, turn-by-turn navigation and choice of
routing, all while reducing the friction of having to swap between apps
- a common complaint amongst professional drivers.

Waze says that this new development is a win for the partners, service
users, and the whole Waze community. Partners will be able to use the
transport sdk to grow their business and build new features that will
make their apps even better. Service users will appreciate fast and
efficient transport routes. The extended community will benefit from the
addition of thousands of drivers which will improve the Waze map and
feed more data back into Waze.\
\
The API is free but currently
[invite-only](https://techcrunch.com/2013/08/22/google-ventures-puts-258m-into-uber-its-largest-deal-ever/).
As partners increase, Waze can only benefit from their data and
engagement.
