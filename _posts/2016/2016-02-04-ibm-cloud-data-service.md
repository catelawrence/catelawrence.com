excerpt: IBM adds to their Cloud Data Services
---
There are certain topics in B2B technology that have staying power.
 Cloud computing and big data are two of these. IBM today announced a
broad expansion of its [Cloud Data
Services](https://www.ibm.biz/open-for-data) portfolio with more than 25
services now available to developers and data scientists.These create
a one-stop-shop for accessing and exploring data and for building and
deploying applications. They can help developers build, deploy and
manage web and mobile applications and also enable data scientists to
discover hidden trends using data and analytics in the cloud. 

In line with the recent trend of commercial tech companies [embracing
the open source
ethos](https://readwrite.com/2016/01/19/open-source-future) (or at least
components of it), these hybrid cloud services can be deployed across
multiple cloud providers and are based on open source technologies, open
ecosystems that include company and third-party data, and open
architectures that allows data to easily flow amongst the different
services. 

IBM's new cloud services include:

-   **IBM Compose Enterprise:** A managed platform designed to help
    development teams build modern web-scale apps faster by enabling
    them to deploy business-ready open source databases in minutes on
    their own dedicated cloud servers.
-   **IBM Graph:** The first fully managed graph database service built
    on Apache*®* TinkerPop that provides developers a complete stack for
    extending business-ready apps with real-time recommendations, fraud
    detection, IoT and network analysis uses.
-   **IBM Predictive Analytics:** A service that allows developers to
    easily self-build machine learning models from a broad library into
    applications to help deliver predictions for specific product use
    cases, without the help of a data scientist.****
-   **IBM Analytics Exchange:** An open data exchange that includes a
    catalog of more than 150 publicly available datasets that can be
    used for analysis or integrated into applications.

IBM’s open approach means that any member of a data team can add or
remove services at any time, to best suit immediate and long-term needs
of their business. Developers can tap IBM Cloud Data Services to openly
and freely move data in, across and out of the services.

Derek Schoettle, General Manager, Analytics Platform and Cloud Data
Services considers IBM's cloud data services to be a
['one-stop-shop'](https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/4/10906882/gear-vr-altspacevr-social-virtual-world-launch) of  data
and analytics services, cloud development platform
[Bluemix](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/?lnk=fif); and Analytics
Exchange, a repository of more than 150 public and free data sources,
everything from census data to government economics statistics. 

He claims the key beneficiaries of cloud data services is the citizen
analyst who can enjoy a 'drag and drop experience' without enlisting the
help of the IT department. Clearly IBM is intent on embracing business
solutions that bring data analysis to the workplace. 

Predictably, IBM has kept its finger in the AI pie with the release
of Predictive Analytics, a complementary service to Apache Spark,
that makes it easier for app developers to build their own machine
learning models based on product use cases. The developer can define the
use case, provide the data set to base the model on, and the Predictive
Analytics service will evaluate a set of algorithms to determine which
one will provide the most accurate predictions. This makes AI
exploration quite accessible to the budding scientist. 

While IBM has a slew of competitors to deal with, they are clearly in
this for the long haul, and it will be interesting to see how their new
services are received by consumers.
