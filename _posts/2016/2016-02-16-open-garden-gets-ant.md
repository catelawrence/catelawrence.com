excerpt: Enhancing Peer To Peer Smart Phone Connections
---
[ Open Garden](https://opengarden.com/home/) is adopting ANT wireless
technology, which will be available in the new release of its flagship
mobile app,
[FireChat](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id719829352?mt=8&&referrer=click%3Dd90f39c8-c18e-44ee-a7cd-56ffe7267c38).
FireChat is the first “off the grid” mobile app that enables people to
communicate for free, even if they do not have access to the Internet, a
cellular network, or a data plan.

FireChat allows people and communities to create their own free
communications networks thanks to its unique peer-to-peer mesh
networking technology. In order to significantly enhance direct
connections between Android smartphones, FireChat now uses the ANT
protocol, in addition to Bluetooth and peer-to-peer WiFi, to let
smartphones connect to each other to exchange messages and photos when
offline.

With this technology, people  don't need a phone signal or Internet
connection to send or download messages - - instead, it connects phones
using Bluetooth and Wi-Fi radio signals as long as they are no more than
200 feet apart. If just five percent of phones in a city use the app,
the company says, then messages can travel through the mesh of
off-the-grid phones to cross the entire city within a few minutes. 

[ANT](https://www.thisisant.com) is an ultra low power (ULP) wireless
networking protocol that enables direct connections between devices and
can be found in everything from fitness sensors to apps and consumer
devices, including over 200 million mobile devices.

Christophe Daligault, CMO of Open Garden sees Firechat as an enabler for
mobile communication in most countries where people can barely afford to
buy a smartphone, let alone a data plan or credits. 

> "Unsurprisingly, more and more people are using FireChat in countries
> such as India, Malaysia, Mexico, and the Philippines. To enable free
> communications in these countries, robust direct connectivity between
> Android mobile devices is critical. This is precisely what ANT helps
> us accomplish.”

The app has been used extensively in countries [when governments
threaten to shut down cellular
wifi](https://readwrite.com/2014/09/29/firechat-hong-kong-protests)such
as Taiwan, Hong Kong, Iraq, and Russia. It also has great implications
for situations when conventional communication is down due to events
such as severe storms or earthquakes and is also useful in situations
like crowded concerts and sporting events. 

Off the grid technology is not new but it has been limited to a lack of
range. The adoption of ANT wireless technology by Open Garden will take
the concept further than before and this is an innovation that is
definitely one to watch.
