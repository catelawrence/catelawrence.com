excerpt: Easy automation for synching your apps
---
![](rw-import/MTM2NDU5MDkwNTA2Mjk0ODgx.png)

This month Zapier announced their new Multi-Step Zaps. If you're not
already familiar with Zapier, it's a handy automation platform which
syncs apps (a process they call zaps), enabling them to talk to each
other and thus perform actions without the need for programming. This
could be as simple as a notification in Slack when your company’s name
is mentioned on Twitter or an automated addition of PayPal customers
emails to a mail chimp list when they make a purchase in your online
store. The 5oo apps available across the spectrum of project management,
ecommerce, customer relations and social media including Asana,
Freshbooks, Buffer, GitHub and SugarSync 

The latest announcement lets users chain as many Actions as desired to a
single Trigger. You're no longer limited to one-to-one connections. You
can even mix-and-match data from multiple apps to pass all the
essentials to a dedicated hub, like routing all customer information
from emails and forms into your CRM or tracking spreadsheet. 

With a workforce that has almost doubled to 36 in the last year, Zapier
is a remote team of specialist staff working across the globe. I spoke
to Danny Schreiber, Marketer at Zapier about the company's new
capabilities and the challenges that result. Zapier's early days saw 50
apps available through their automation services. a number which has now
grown to over 500. Danny admits that this has not been without its
challenges especially if service goes down on a single app. "Now a third
of our term are customer support and we employ 20 engineers to ensure
that the service is reliable, easy to use and we’ll be there if
something goes wrong". 

He admits that there's a veritable wish list of apps that customers
really want to app to Zapier, "Oracle, Excel and Microsoft dynamics,
these integrations are more complex and require more testing and more
quality assurance". They also are hoping to enable team accounts for
workplace departments in the new future as Danny notes "Hundreds of
people are asking for this feature and we are working hard to make it
happen"

For those wanting to crank it up a notch, Zapier has also enabled Code
integration to let customers write simple code for tasking like
formatting names and email addresses and converting date formats to be
relevant to the requirements of different countries.

The future can only be bright for Zapier as Danny predicts "I think
we'll have more than 1000 apps by 2017".
