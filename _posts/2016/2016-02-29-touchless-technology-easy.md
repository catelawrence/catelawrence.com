excerpt: New gesture control technology available to mobile industry
---

[Elliptic Labs](https://www.ellipticlabs.com/) has been passionate about
gesture-controlled technology since its founding in 2006. While much of
their energy has been focused on a touch-free mobile phone experience -
enabling hands-free video recording and selfies - they unveiled EASY IoT
software at Mobile World Congress, allowing controlling IoT appliances
to take place with simple hand gestures. The technology can be
applicable to devices like smart thermostats, kitchen appliances,
lighting controls, and security systems, to name a few.
