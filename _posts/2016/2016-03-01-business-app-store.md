excerpt: Atlassian gets B2B developer kudos
---

Developers love Australian enterprise software company
[Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/) for its first and most popular
product, [JIRA](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira?_mid=86ef4f53896fdb61cc6c2cc0e849441c&gclid=CjwKEAiA9c-2BRC_vaaJ0Ybps30SJABlqxDesj6-lKQSkPn5rLh3AA2NkS6_HJh0l59oSTvbui_NvBoC5MDw_wcB),
used across many applications being developed by teams around the world.
It's a product that has grown beyond its developer focus, with Atlassian
claiming that over a third of its users come from businesses units
outside of software development, including sales, marketing, and HR. Key
customers include NASA, Twitter, and Tesla.
