excerpt: Israeli firm's next-gen human-machine vocal interface goes straight to your
  ears   - without any hardware IN your ears
---

It's not that often that you witness a product demonstration that
absolutely blows your mind. But at last week's Mobile World Congress,
Israeli company Noveto Systems did just that. They are developing the
next-generation of human-machine vocal interface, enabling
sound-emitting devices to transmit sound beams to the user's ears only,
without any external hardware on the user.
