I was fortunate to meet Pepper at Mobile World Congress a few weeks ago
in Barcelona. Pepper is a personable robot created
by [SoftBank](https://www.softbank.jp/), one of Japan’s biggest
telecommunications companies, in collaboration with its subsidiary, the
Paris-based humanoid robotics experts
[Aldebaran](https://www.aldebaran.com/en).
