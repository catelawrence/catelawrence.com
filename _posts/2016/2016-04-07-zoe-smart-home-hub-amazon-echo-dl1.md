One of the more interesting products to appear in the IoT space of late
is Protonet's ZOE, a smart home hub that's competing with Amazon's Echo
for the home market.

[You may remember [Protonet](https://protonetinc.com/) as the company
that broke the internet back in 2014 by crowdfunding [[\$1 million in 89
minutes]{.s3}](https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/nsa-proof-server-protonet-smashes-crowdfunding-record-by-raising-1m-89-minutes-1451301)
and completed the delivery too. The previous project resulted in \$4
million raised and set the path for a successful [[Free Your Data
Campaign]{.s2}](https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/12/free-your-data/)]{.s1}[.]{.s4} In
2014, Protonet was awarded the crowdfunding World Champion by Seedmatch,
with an investment of USD\$3.4 [million]{.xn-money} and was later
elected the 2014 startup of the year.

Protonet is headquartered in [Hamburg, Germany]{.xn-location} and more
recently opened offices in the [San Francisco]{.xn-location} Bay area.

Protonet's point of difference to existing products such as Amazon Echo
or Google's Nest cam, is that it extends it's ready made private cloud
server technology to home IoT, with ZOE operating outside of the cloud
and data centres.

I spoke to Ali Jelveh, Protonet co-founder and CEO.

“With the Protonet ZOE, we will bring one of the smartest and most
aesthetic Smart Home Hubs to market. Our clear goal is 'The Home of the
Free made smart' because people should be able to choose how to live
with modern technology, even at home," he said. "We stand for
intelligence and data privacy with our products, and have proved that
these aspects are compatible.”

In terms of functionality, The Smart Home Hub understands 1500
voice-commands, learns additional vocabulary with every software-update
and syntax-detection of new sentences. All voice-data is stored onto the
2GB encrypted local memory. Protonet ZOE includes “Drops," - small
mobile devices which can be placed all over the house so that voice
commands can be received in all rooms and on all floors of the house.
They can be turned off manually, so that private matters stay private.

With the help of these Drops, ZOE understands which room a person is
standing in and from which room they are giving their spoken command. As
Jelveh explains: "Due to this, I can say from the bedroom 'Hey, ZOE,
turn off the lights' and the lights will, in fact, only turn off in my
bedroom – even though ZOE is managing my whole house."

Interestingly, this new Smart Home Hub does not charge any monthly fees
and functions independently of any cloud, which means that it can work
without the need of an internet or Wi-Fi connection.

ZOE learns your smart-home habits
---------------------------------

Jelveh said that "a smart home only truly becomes smart once it starts
to learn, whether recognizing a pattern or learning a new skill." ZOE is
powered with 'IFTTT' capabilities, meaning that it is possible to teach
Protonet ZOE actions that are subject to certain conditions, such as
turning on the sound system when entering the room. With time, Protonet
ZOE learns the various behavioral patterns of its owners and coordinates
the smart home devices accordingly.

The product is extendable, thanks to its two USB ports, and speaks the
most common programming languages. It supports wireless, Bluetooth,
Z-wave, and cloud connected devices.

The intention is to make it open source - to welcome tinkerers and
developers to create more uses for ZOE.

Jelveh predicts that "we are moving to a digital world, we we have to be
conscious of what it means. One of the things about humans is they will
connect whatever they can connect. We're going to see the rise of a
consciousness movement about what we really want connected."

"Most smart-home central (units) are nothing more than multifunctional
remote controls," he adds. "ZOE, on the other hand, proactively thinks.
She recognizes my patterns and acts as a smart assistant upon request.
As soon as I leave my house, she proactively reminds me about forgotten
devices, open windows or activates my un-activated burglar alarm. On the
way home, I can prepare my house for my return at the push of a button."

Born in Iran, Jelveh moved to France and grew up in Germany.  He notes
that the tech scene is Germany is young compared for Silicon Valley,
"where you meet veterans who have started three or four companies,' he
said. He hopes that their product will shake Silicon Valley of some of
its "arrogance" and hopes to empower both consuming choice and privacy.
 Will the message be received? We'll have to wait and see.
