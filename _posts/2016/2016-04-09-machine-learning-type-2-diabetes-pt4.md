[[Suggestic](https://suggestic.com/) is a digital startup trying to
tackle [Type 2
diabetes](https://readwrite.com/2015/02/10/apple-watch-dexcom-app-diabetes-glucose-monitoring/)
using machine learning to create personalized interventions and guide
users through them towards disease reversal.  ]{.s1}

[The founders have created a "lifestyle GPS" app that works as a
personal assistant to help people with Type 2 diabetes navigate
towards a healthier lifestyle by providing contextual suggestions
related to nutrition, physical activity, exercise, sleep and stress
management. ]{.s1}Focusing on the concept of precision medicine -
targeted treatment based on an individual’s gene, environment and
lifestyle - it employs machine learning technology to extract and
validate causal patterns between each person’s genes, metabolism, diet
and psychology.

I spoke to Shai Rosen, CMO and founder, who explained that the impetus
for Suggestic came from personal experience, with himself and another
founder having lost family members due to complications caused by Type 2
diabetes and two of their team being diagnosed pre-diabetic (now
reserved). Shai detailed the need in healthcare to view the person
beyond their medical self

"We need to really  understand who is the person and what is the right
intervention for them…. to see the patient as not only a biological
being but also psychological self which changes in different contexts.
To really do this, we need machine learning," Rosen said.

By adapting machine-learning models, Suggestic culls and analyzes
correlated patterns between the user’s genes, diet and metabolism, then
generates personalized recommendations to reverse the diabetes.

"Adequate control can lead in many cases to the reversal of symptoms and
biomarkers enabling persons with diabetes to lead an almost normal
life," Shai explains. "That is the reversal we are aiming for by helping
them change and maintain the healthiest lifestyle for each individual."

Suggestic augments existing care
--------------------------------

Users will download Suggestic’s app and receive baseline dietary and
exercise advice for diabetics. From there “you add layers of
personalization,” Shai says, from age and weight to lab results and
known blood-sugar triggers, [stressing that their role was not to
replace that of health professionals, but rather to extend or augment
their work, particularly in the area of better adherence to treatment
and improved care. ]{.s1}

Suggestic is still in early stages of testing, having only recently
moved from a  closed alpha phase to closed beta phase. They currently
have a waiting list of over 1,000 people wanting to access their
platform, which will be offered free to health consumers.

There's also plans to incorporate components of their platform into
employee wellness plans with the goal to produce reduced absenteeism and
enhanced productivity at work and fewer doctor visits. "I always thought
mainstream users would be the drivers, but we have also been approached
by big health organizations and pharmaceutical companies," Shai admits.
"We’ve been impressed at how open the medical industry has been to use
AI and talk about personalization, particularly when it comes to
 lifestyle and treatment compliance."

Suggestic is constantly crunching data and with an emphasis on evidence
based medicine and is backed by a board of health professionals,
geneticists and machine learning academics. They have a team of
 investors that Shai considers "patient and really understanding of the
time this kind of work takes. We will not hurry our process beyond what
makes sense just to please an investor."

The crossroads between machine learning and personalized healthcare is
definitely something that will become an important part of medicine, and
it will be interesting to see the outcomes of later trials by Suggestic
as they work to improve the prognosis for those afflicted by diabetes.
