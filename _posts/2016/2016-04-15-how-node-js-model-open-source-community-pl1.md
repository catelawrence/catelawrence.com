[The creation of programming languages and platforms is rarely without
challenges. A case in point is in the experiences of the community
around the Node.js platform. Node.js allows the creation of backend
services using JavaScript and a collection of "modules" that handle
various core functionality and other core functions. Node.js' modules
use an API designed to reduce the complexity of writing server
applications. Node.js' package
ecosystem, ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[[npm]{style="font-weight: 400;"}](https://www.npmjs.com/)[,
is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the
world.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

</div>

There are currently 5 billion connected devices and that will increase
tremendously over the next few years. The current and continued need to
connect these devices is very important, and many companies - including
IBM, Samsung, Intel, and Microsoft - see both APIs as the key to connect
these devices and [Node]{.il}.js as the glue that connects them.

<div>

[ I spoke with members of Node.js about their experiences in the
community, recently at the ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[[Linux
Foundation Collaboration
Summit.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/collaboration-summit)

A short Node.js history of the problem
--------------------------------------

[Node.js emerged in May 2009 and is a child of the git
and ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[[GitHub]{style="font-weight: 400;"}](https://github.com/)[ era
of open source. Its relatively short history offers not only lessons,
but also solutions to open source communities dealing with internal
conflict for those who function in this new era of development. A few
years ago, Node.js had just a few committers (contributors with write
access to the repository in order to merge code and triage bugs).
Questions were raised about the managing structures and the
personalities within. The maintenance overhead for the few committers on
Node.js Core was overwhelming and the project began to see a decline in
both committers and outside contribution. This resulted in a
corresponding decline in releases.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

[According to those invested in the project like James Snell - now IBM's
Technical Lead for Node.js and a member of the Node.js core Technical
Steering Committee: ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

> ["Developers did not feel empowered to make changes, this drove away
> developers... the innovation decreased and it became less interesting
> to invest in the project.”]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

A change to "open" open source
------------------------------

[In response to these challenges and corresponding governance conflict,
in December 2014, Fedor Indutny
started ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[[io.js]{style="font-weight: 400;"}](https://iojs.org/en/)[,
a fork of Node.js. Unlike Node.js, the authors planned to keep io.js
up-to-date with the latest releases of the Google V8 JavaScript engine.
io.js' point of difference was that it operated using principles
consistent with
the ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[[Do-ocracy]{style="font-weight: 400;"}](https://communitywiki.org/DoOcracy)[ movement, an
organizational structure in which individuals choose roles and tasks for
themselves and execute them. Responsibilities attach to people
who ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}**do**[ the work, rather than elected or
selected officials. Snell revealed that]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

> ["By liberalizing the contribution process we stabilized the platform
> more." He went on to explain that contributions by community members
> to the code, community or documentation defined those involved in
> decision making as "everyone who pushes a request had an equal seat at
> the table."]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

[In the first few months io.js attracted more active developers than the
node.js project has had in its entire
history.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

[In February 2015, the intent to form a neutral Node.js Foundation was
announced. By June 2015, the Node.js and io.js communities voted to work
together under the Node.js Foundation. Node.js v0.12 and io.js v3.3 were
merged back together into Node v4.0. This brought V8 features into
Node.js, and a long-term support release
cycle.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[ ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

 A new way forward
------------------

[The Node.js Foundation governance was divided into two entities with
equal standing: A Business Board   - responsible for business, marketing
and legal direction - and a Technical Steering Committee - responsible
for code development, testing, integration, and working groups and
projects. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

[Snell explained that:]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

> ["Having a governance structure enabled decision making clarity and
> essentially resolved personality issues."]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

[ This also left room for developer-driver innovation as Snell
commented, ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

> ["Our road map is whatever developers and contributors want to do and
> is reflected in the commit history."]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

.size-full .wp-image-583 width="749"
height="440"} ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

[Today, the Node.js project is divided into many components with a full
organizational size of well over 400 members. Node.js Core now has over
50 committers and over 100 contributors per
month. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[[Mikeal
Rogers]{style="font-weight: 400;"}](https://mikealrogers.com/)[, now
community manager of the Node.js Foundation, explained that this
innovation has extended into other areas of the
foundation.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

["We've just started doing analytics around who are our modern open
source developers. We've trying to cater to more casual users and on how
to convert users into participants. People don't want to be passive
consumers and we've trying to remove the barriers to
participation."]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[ ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

[The Foundation’s ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[[Technical Steering
Committee
(TSC)]{style="font-weight: 400;"}](https://nodejs.org/en/foundation/tsc/)[ oversees
a range of committees including the Inclusivity Working Group. They've
introduced practical ways to be inclusive like a policy for timezones
requiring "pull requests should sit for at least 36 hours to ensure that
contributors in other timezones have time to review," Rogers
said.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

["As projects mature, there’s a tendency to become top heavy and overly
hierarchical as a means of quality control and this is enforced through
process," he added. "We use process to add transparency that encourages
participation, which grows the code review pool which leads to better
quality control. More people means more reviews and more checks and
balances. We also break core groups into working groups to avoid being
top heavy."]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

[[With a growing community of not only the interested but also the
committed, Node.js demonstrates that liberalizing contributions and
participatory governance will be the future of open source development
and as they continue to scale, they'll create a legacy that future
communities will strive to
follow.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}]{style="font-weight: 400;"}
