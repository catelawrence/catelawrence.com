[This week sportswear maker adidas debuted a new wearable device,
co-developed with [Interactive Health Technologies](https://ihtusa.com/)
(IHT). Called the adidas ZONE for IHT Spirit, it's the first wrist-based
wearable device developed specifically for physical education class
use.]{.s1}

[Currently, IHT supports 1,500 teachers in 800 schools across the
country and during the 2015 school year, 600,000 children were connected
to the IHT Spirit System. With the help of the new wearable, IHT is on
track to hit their 2016 target of interacting with one million students
nationwide on a daily basis.]{.s1}

[The ZONE is a wrist-worn, heart rate monitoring device that integrates
into the existing IHT Spirit System - a cloud-based curriculum for
physical education (PE) - that allows teachers to efficiently track each
student’s performance in PE class, creating individualized workouts and
goals for students based on their personal fitness levels. The product
is built to meet the needs of teachers across the country, durable
enough for multiple students to wear during PE classes, and can sync
quickly, using NFC technology. Heart rate training is accompanied by
pedometer data, IHT's PE 3 project-based curriculum, and the adidas
Challenges program which uses cloud-based software]{.s1}

Stacey Burr, VP and general manager of adidas Digital Sports said that
"in working with IHT, we found a partner that shared our vision of
inspiring the next generation to lead healthy lives by making sport and
fitness a life-long pursuit. We’re firm believers that healthy habits
are easier to keep the earlier you start, so introducing tools and
resources at the school-level offered the perfect place to lay such an
important foundation.“

Adidas can boost kids' performance...if they still have PE classes
------------------------------------------------------------------

It's unclear how the program will help those subject to the alarming
trend of PE classes being reduced or eliminated from school curriculums
across the US that adidas aims to address. It is, after all, likely that
the wearable and curriculum will be more readily adopted by school
already invested in sports than those without resources or funding.

I also can't help wondering about the privacy of the data, as adidas
asks you to "imagine 12 years from today, when your 1st graders receive
their high school diploma and along with it, are handed their entire
wellness portfolio correlated to their academic, attendance and fitness
success. A legacy created for students and their families while meeting
the daily needs of school administration and compliance."  Would such
data be attached to college and job applications of the future? What are
the consequences for future health insurance?

[It's also worthy considering that unless a lifetime warranty is
available - that's unclear at this stage - a device targeting K-12
students is likely to require repeat purchases. The device retails at
\$139, and is also available for schools to buy for students in PE
through [package pricing](https://ihtusa.com/zone-pricing/). ]{.s1}
