[Buddy](https://buddy.com/) has a goal, to use IoT for the greater good.
They've created a water quality demo that showcases how Buddy integrates
with distributed devices and sensors as part of an initiative they are
setting up called *IoT for Impact*.

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div>

The result is quality, real-time data, that could be used to
preemptively alert health officials of system abnormalities - like those
that impacted Flint, Michigan, recently - that could then be addressed
immediately.

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div>

I spoke to CEO and co-founder David McLauchlan, about the initiative. He
explained:

</div>

> <div>
>
> </div>
>
> <div>
>
> To some, IoT data is seen as superfluous.  Events with disastrous
> impact are surfacing all around us and coming to a head. The
> contaminated drinking water in Flint, poisoned water from fracking in
> New York and Pennsylvania, continued *e. coli* and listeria break outs
> in Massachusetts, or air quality issues in Oregon — these problems
> could have been predicted or in some way contained if IoT technology
> had been implemented.
>
> </div>

<div>

</div>

<div>

If sensors were placed in common water filters used in homes, the Flint
water crisis could have been discovered and remediated. This could
extend to solve other environmental problems, for example:

</div>

> <div>
>
> If air quality sensors were as inexpensive and easy to install as LED
> garden lights, how many homeowners would be willing to place them in
> their yard and contribute to an early warning system for abnormal
> levels of pollution? And if micro-thermometers could be packaged with
> meat and produce from the time of harvest to the time of consumption,
> how quickly would noxious foods and their origins be identified and
> mitigated?
>
> </div>

<div>

[McLauchlan believes there's a real opportunity for [IoT data to bring
value to
communities](https://readwrite.com/2016/04/11/smart-citizens-lost-rush-make-smart-cities-cl4/)by
predicting these events. He wants to start a conversation that will
engage and ideally move other IoT and data solution providers into
taking action. Fundamentally, he believes that people and positive
social impact should be at the center of IoT value creation. ]{.s1}

**How could it work?**

</div>

<div>

The Buddy demo uses water turbidity as a proxy for the overall water
quality.  A variety of other water quality characteristics could be
measured using this same design.  In their demo, data is captured from a
turbidity sensor and displayed real-time on a dashboard.  If the
turbidity level crosses a certain threshold (for example, 100 NTU), the
sensor alerts by changing the color of smart lightbulbs in two separate
locations.

The demo can be broken down into the following key steps:

1.  Turbidity sensor is placed in water sample
2.  Data is collected, processed, and streamed real-time to Splunk
3.  As the sensor detects key thresholds, light bulbs change color
    indicating a threshold was met
4.  Data is compared against a data-set of water quality data provided
    by USGS

Flint and other cities need help from all sectors
-------------------------------------------------

[McLaughlan admits that none of this is easy.  ]{.s1}

> [Sensor and beacon developers must work with product manufacturers to
> enable easy, low-cost data generation and transmission. Data
> collection, aggregation and processing platforms must be able to
> ingest the data, connect it to advanced software tools and make it
> accessible for in-depth analyses. And public agencies, policymakers,
> advocacy groups and scientific organizations must leverage the data in
> ways that increase our collective ability to prevent or minimize
> social crises.]{.s1}
>
> [This type of information supply chain can’t happen in a vacuum. It
> can’t be achieved through closed-door meetings, and it can’t be
> contained in a lab. It requires widespread participation and
> collaboration, but the incentives are clear. [Businesses can
> profit.](https://readwrite.com/2016/04/08/iiot-strengthens-investment-outlook-morgan-stanley-if4/)
> Public agencies can reduce the human and financial cost of health
> crises. And individuals can play a greater role in their own safety
> and well-being.]{.s1}

It will be exciting to follow up on *IoT for Impact* and the goal to
create an [information supply chain that would help confront—and in many
cases prevent—human emergencies.]{.s1}
