In the era of [the quantified self](https://quantifiedself.com/) we are
able to use a range of trackers and monitors within the Internet of
Things (IoT) to assess and monitor our health throughout each day and
night. But a small suite of companies like
[Thync](https://www.thync.com/) and [Fisher Wallace
Laboratories](https://www.fisherwallace.com/?gclid=CPyOvdWMjswCFbgy0wodsS4AUg) have
extended this reach to the use of  wearables to transform the
capabilities of the brain to manage conditions like mild fatigue,
depression and insomnia.

<div>

The latest device comes from [Halo Neuro](https://www.haloneuro.com/), a
headset called Halo Sport, targeting athletes that resembles headphones
and uses what it calls
[neuro-priming](https://www.haloneuro.com/) - another term for
[transcranial direct current
stimulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcranial_direct-current_stimulation) which
involves the use of electrical pulses to encourage the brain to form new
pathways to increase performance. It's an approach that comes deeply
steeped in
[scientific](https://halo-website-static-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/whitepapers/mvc.pdf)
[research](https://halo-website-static-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/whitepapers/mvc.pdf).
Halo Neuro consists of a team of 20 with impressive credentials, half of
which are engineers, the rest doctors and neuroscientists.

I recently spoke to Halo’s co-founder and CEO, Dr. Daniel Chao, about
how Halo Sport works and the impetus for the latest wearable.

He explained some of their background research around neuro-priming
which involved double-blind, controlled experiments with 1,000 people to
determine efficacy and safety:

Halo Sport brings results for U.S. ski team
-------------------------------------------

The results are impressive. On average Halo is shown to increase
learning by 50% and overall performance by 10%. The United States
Olympic Ski & Snowboard association used Halo and saw a 1.7X increase in
performance with their athletes.\

Pro athletes everywhere from the
[NFL](https://readwrite.com/2016/04/06/nfl-found-iot-vl2/)'s combine to
MLB teams are using Halo to improve their game. Halo released a limited
run of their consumer headsets shipping this fall and they are gearing
up to announce a general availability preorder date this fall.

</div>

In the first instance the pool of elite athletes seem an odd focus,
given the size of the pool - particularly as Chao's previous business,
[NeuroPace](https://www.neuropace.com/), developed an FDA-approved
implantable brain stimulator for epilepsy.

Dr. Chao explained that the minutiae of improvement in elite sports is
why they were the perfect people:

> <div>
>
> "In elite athletes, 1-2% improvement is huge.  For example, we've been
> doing some work with the US Ski Team. I  was invited to do the World
> Championships and noticed that with any of these sports at the highest
> level,  the difference between 1st and 2nd place   - let alone 20th -
> is just a sliver".

However Neuro Sport is not limited to athletes in their prime but can
have benefits to even the amateur or enthusiastic athlete. I was curious
to see if Dr. Chao had tested the headset on himself:

Halo is already working with some of the nation’s top hospitals on
researching the use of their technology to accelerate the rate of
recovery in stroke patients. The U.S. Military has accelerated pilot and
sniper training by 50% with neurotechnology similar to Halo Sport.
Further down the road, Halo plans to release a model to improve memory
and hopefully aid Alzheimer's patients.
