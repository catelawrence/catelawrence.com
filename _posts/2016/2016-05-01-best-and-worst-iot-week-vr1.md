It's a tech party and IoT is everywhere right now - loud, noisy and on
the dance floor with a tie around its head.

With so much energy in being devoted to tell us how, when, where, what
we can connect to each other, the "why" may be getting a little blurry.
So we want to take a step back every now and take a critical look at the
connected devices that actually go out and buy, right now.

*(Ed note: We also do a [round-up of
crowdfunding](https://readwrite.com/2016/04/24/crowdfunding-iot-projects-watch-week-dl1/)
ideas you can't quite get yet...or possibly should never be able to
get.)*

Here's what caught our eye, for all the right - or wrong - reasons:

The Best of.....
----------------

***Bios incube***

![0f4245e19921e69368b724cf6d090a10\_original](rw-import/0f4245e19921e69368b724cf6d090a10_original.jpg){.wp-image-1150

Whatever your views on the existence of the afterlife, reality is that
cemetery space is becoming a crowded, expensive, commodity. The
alternative cremation results in the question of how to deal with the
ashes, with the options not  all that appealing, especially if you've
already been to a [scattering of ashes where the wind blew them back in
the faces of the bereaved.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4ezPvzKe5M)

Now there's another option thanks to Bios Incube, a biodegradable urn
containing a tree seed in which you can place the ashes and monitor
remotely. According to the manufacturers, "the urn provides proper
germination and later growth of the tree, based on a person or pet’s
ashes. In this way, death becomes a transformation and return to life by
means of nature". The Bios Incube is a step up the from the creators
earlier device of simply a seed and a biodegradable urn, and it is
designed to  facilitate growth, and enables you to track and monitor
your Bios Urn. A corresponding mobile app tells you how your tree is
growing, and when necessary, provide advice for maintenance...because
surely there'd be nothing worse than planting a loved one's ashes with a
growing tree only to have it die on you, too?

 

***Cloud: Smart***

![4-11](rw-import/4-11.jpg){.wp-image-1407
.aligncenter width="549" height="549"}

*[The Cloud](https://www.richardclarkson.com/shop/cloud)* is "an
interactive speaker/lamp designed to mimic a thunderstorm in both sound
and light. Functions include: streaming music via Bluetooth, music
visualization, motion sensing & creating ambient light displays." Think
of it as a self-indulgent piece of interactive art. That makes the
\$3,360 price tag more palatable.

 

***Nora***

.aligncenter width="501" height="461"}

When you're from a family of chronic snorers and you've all spent time
in sleep clinics to no avail, a product that not only aims to prevent
snoring  but is also backed by sleep scientists is very appealing.
[Nora](https://www.smartnora.com/) is a wireless device that detects the
early sounds of snoring then gently moves your head by activating a
padded insert in your pillow case. The insert is inflated and the
movement treats the cause of snoring, the relaxed throat muscles,
allowing the airway to clear and the breathing to continue. The \$259
price is far cheaper than renting an apartment with a spare bedroom.

...and the worst
----------------

***Peggy***

![](rw-import/peggy-1024x682.jpg){.wp-image-1148
.aligncenter width="549" height="366"}

[Peggy](https://www.omo.com.au/peggy/) is a smart clothes peg bought to
you by detergent-maker Omo. It measures temperature and humidity with a
corresponding app that helps you decide when you dry your clothes
outside. Note to Peggy users: Go outside. Just for a while. You probably
won't die.

***Juicero***

![juicero\_image](rw-import/juicero_image.png){.wp-image-1149
.aligncenter width="603" height="363"}

Cold-pressed juice has become smart thanks to
[Juicero](https://www.juicero.com/). Juicing is no longer about chopping
up some fresh fruit and extracting the juice. Instead you have to buynot
only the juicer but also a subscription to space age-like single serve
packages of diced fruit and vegetables which when added to the machine
will give you one glass of juice. Where does the IoT come in? According
to the website:

> "Connectivity is a key component of the Juicero system. Being
> connected to the internet ensures that you have the latest updates and
> that your Press is operating optimally. Once everything is synced,
> you’ll be able to rely on the app to see which Packs you’ve consumed
> and which ones still remain. To ensure you’re drinking the highest
> quality juice, the app will also notify you when Packs are about to
> expire." In case that's not enough to tempt you, "you’ll always know
> which nutrients you’re consuming and which farm grew each ingredient."
>
>  

At \$700 for the juicer and  the requisite juice packs at \$5 each, the
local artisan bio-cafe is looking a lot more accessible. When did
cutting an orange in half become too hard?

***The Control Freak***

![ControlFreak\_2nd\_grande](rw-import/ControlFreak_2nd_grande.jpg){.size-full
.wp-image-1151 .aligncenter width="600" height="600"}

The mere name of this product makes me think of A-type personalities who
use their kitchen more for storing take-out sushi chopsticks than actual
food prep. Yes, [The Control
Freak](https://polyscienceculinary.com/products/the-control-freak) is
actually the name of this stove top, a collaboration between Breville
and Polyscience, who assert:

> "It's the first of its kind to accurately measure, set and hold 397
> cooking temperatures from 86°-482°F. The unique real-time sensing
> system uses a through-glass sensor to directly measure surface
> temperature. Probe Control™ remote thermometer to precisely control
> the temperature of both water and fat-based liquids."

Once you've seen the magic you can do with an old battered wok over a
flame, the price of \$1,799.95 is laughable. Perhaps learning to cook
with the stuff in your kitchen already is a better start.

best and worst and my favorites will get a mention.*
