Apple has been instrumental in pairing medicine and mobile technology
through its series of kits. In March 2015, they launched
[ResearchKit](https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2015/03/09Apple-Introduces-ResearchKit-Giving-Medical-Researchers-the-Tools-to-Revolutionize-Medical-Studies.html),
an open source software framework to help scientists and doctors not
only create medical apps but also recruit patients for clinical trials
and research products.

ResearchKit turns iPhone into a powerful tool for medical research. When
granted permission by the user, apps can access data from the Health app
such as weight, blood pressure, glucose levels and asthma inhaler use,
which are measured by third-party devices and apps. ResearchKit can also
request from a user, access to the accelerometer, microphone, gyroscope
and GPS sensors in iPhone to gain insight into a patient’s gait, motor
impairment, fitness, speech and memory.

In March this year, they [announced
CareKit](https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2016/03/21Apple-Advances-Health-Apps-with-CareKit.html),
a new development framework for clinical care apps. The software is
designed help developers enable people to actively manage their own
medical conditions through app-based care plans, and symptom and
medication monitoring. This can leads to insights that help people
better understand their own health.

CareKit currently includes four modules:

1.  *Care Card* helps people track their individual care plans and
    action items, such as taking medication or completing physical
    therapy exercises. Activities can automatically be tracked and
    entered using sensors in Apple Watch® or iPhone
2.  *Symptom and Measurement Tracke*r lets users easily record their
    symptoms and how they’re feeling, like monitoring temperature for
    possible infections or measuring pain or fatigue. Progress updates
    could include simple surveys, photos that capture the progression of
    a wound or activities calculated by using the iPhone’s accelerometer
    and gyroscope, like quantifying range of motion;
3.  *Insight Dashboard* maps symptoms against the action items in the
    Care Card to easily show how treatments are working
4.  *Connect* makes it easy for people to share information and
    communicate with doctors, care teams or family members about their
    health and any change in condition

Research kits has been met with positive results from the medical
community. “With ResearchKit, we quickly realized the power of mobile
apps for running inexpensive, high-quality clinical studies with
unprecedented reach,” said Ray Dorsey, MD, David M. Levy Professor of
Neurology at the University of Rochester Medical Center.

> “We hope that CareKit will help us close the gap between our research
> findings and how we care for our Parkinson’s patients day-to-day. It’s
> opening up a whole new opportunity for the democratization of research
> and medicine.”

Apple seeks to professionalize health apps
------------------------------------------

Apple's efforts leads to a greater professionalisation of 'health and
wellbeing' apps - a lucrative industry that lacks any accredited
regulation. At present they do not need to be designed by or in
collaboration with health professionals or endorse tools or treatments
that are subject to peer reviewed papers and research based trials.  For
example, a [study
released](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4376135/#ref68)in
2015 analyzing 243 depression apps available during 2013 revealed that
many fail to incorporate evidence-based practices, health behavior
theory, or clinical expertise into their design. The study excluded
almost this many again for the lack of reporting of organizational
affiliation and content sources.

Likewise,[a study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26787311) was
released this year of apps that explicitly included or advertised
pregnancy prevention or decision-making support. Intensive analysis was
undertaken of 18 apps. Of these,  41% of apps did not mention any modern
contraceptive methods and 23% mentioned only 1 method. Of apps that did
mention a modern contraceptive method, fewer than 50% of these apps
provided information on how to use it. The researchers further found
that most apps  miss opportunities to provide users with valuable
information, interactive decision aids, and evidence-based interventions
for unintended pregnancy prevention. The researcher further contend that

> "some apps in this space may increase the likelihood of unintended
> pregnancy due to the low effectiveness of the contraceptive methods
> promoted."

[Other research
highlights](https://www.psychology.org.au/Content.aspx?ID=5850) the
problem of clinical assessment of apps due to search terms/procedures
used, the retail stores/research databases searched and the criteria
that is used to determine app quality.

What is and isn't a health app?
-------------------------------

According to
[guidelines](https://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/.../UCM263366.pdf)
by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  in February 2015, apps
that are considered a medical device category, require FDA review before
they can go to market legally. A medical device can include software
that is intended for use in one of three situations:

1.  To diagnose a disease or other condition
2.  Cure, mitigate, prevent, or treat a disease
3.  Affect a bodily function or structure

Interestingly, there are also several categories of mobile apps for
which the FDA plans to exercise enforcement discretion but not actively
regulate. These include apps that:

-   Help users self-manage their disease or condition without providing
    specific treatment or treatment suggestions
-   Provide patients with simple tools to organize and track their
    health information
-   Provide easy access to information related to a patient’s health
    conditions or treatments
-   Help patients document, show, or communicate potential medical
    conditions to healthcare providers
-   Automate simple tasks for healthcare providers
-   Enable patients or providers to interact with personal health
    records or electronic health record systems

It's highly likely that most developers of health apps who are not
science or health professionals themselves, are most likely to want to
avoid a FDA review-a process that is time consuming and expensive.
Rather than reducing the amount of apps on offer, it is more likely to
result in more generic or generalist knowledge or a self-classification
under "well-being," a category that the FDA considers most relative to a
healthy lifestyle than health.

What is missing from AppleKits?
-------------------------------

It's notable that while Apple has been working hard to create software
platforms suitable for iPhone apps, there has been something of a missed
opportunity for engagement with other connected devices utilized now (or
in the future) by health professionals that would utilize CareKit. For
example, whilst patients can share medical data with doctors, there is
no corresponding platform for integrating the data into patient
electronic health records or a means to compare the data with other
patients utilizing the same app. Whilst patient adherence is a common
challenge of any health regime, without tools to ensure health
professionals can also do so with the resultant data is imperative.
