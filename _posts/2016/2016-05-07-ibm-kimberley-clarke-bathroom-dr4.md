[IBM]{.linkOnClick} announced recently that the professional division of
Kimberly-Clark, maker of such household brands as Kleenex and Huggies,
has adopted [IBM
Cloud](https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/in/en/){.linkOnClick} to
create a facilities management app that helps clients better monitor and
manage restrooms remotely, lowering costs and improving consumer
experiences.

Kimberly-Clark Professional's new Intelligent Restroom app was built
using [IBM
Bluemix](https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/?cm_mmc=Search_gsn-_-Cloud_Bluemix_Keyword-Branded_Try-_-WW_DE-_-ibm%20blue%20mix_Exact)
development platform and through the use of the [IBM Internet of Things
Foundation]{.linkOnClick} service, facilities managers collect data and
alerts from sensors integrated into restroom amenities, from soap
dispensers to air fresheners, as well as non-amenities like entrance
doors. All the data is managed and monitored through a central dashboard
that can be viewed on desktops or mobile devices remotely.

In pilot tests of the Intelligent Restroom, Kimberly-Clark Professional
has been able to reduce the amount of supplies used in the restroom by
up to 20 percent.

[According to Bryan Semkuley]{.xn-person}, Vice President of Global
Innovation at Kimberly-Clark Professional. "We wanted to help our
clients reduce tenant churn, lower costs, and improve the customers'
experience along the way. That's when we turned to innovations in cloud
and IoT from IBM that can be operated from facilities managers'
smartphones."

> "Kimberly-Clark Professional products are used by one fourth of the
> world's population on a regular basis," said [Rachel
> Reinitz]{.xn-person}, IBM Distinguished Engineer and CTO, IBM Bluemix
> Garage. "IBM Cloud, from development platform through IoT, enabled
> them to develop and deploy the innovative Intelligent Restroom from
> the ground up."

Will the connected bathroom be coming to your home?

If you are curious whether such technology extends to the home, the
answer is yes...and no. IoT company
[RollScout](https://www.rollscout.com/index.php/available-styles) launched
a (failed)
[crowdfunding](https://readwrite.com/2016/04/24/crowdfunding-iot-projects-watch-week-dl1/) effort
in 2014 for a connected toilet roll holder, relying on sensor
technology, to notify folks when the toilet roll needed to be
replenished. When the level of paper on the roll fell below a certain
level, a warning system was turned on, a pulsing ring of amber light
bright enough to be noticeable even in daylight conditions along with a
corresponding app. The company was offered the devices from \$79 to a
gold-plated version for \$149. Unfortunately, they never went to market.
An idea before its time?

Predictably, connected toilets also exist. In Japan, there's the
[Satis](https://www.lixil.co.jp/lineup/toiletroom/satis/smartphone/), a
connected toilet where an app can enable the lifting of the toilet seas
or a flush. The app also lets the user maintain a diary of toilet use
and even play music through built-in speakers.

You can also buy  a toilet with all the bells and whistles courtesy of
[Panasonic](https://www.panasonic.hk/english/products/living/bathroom-appliances/toilet-seat/dl-sz45hwm.aspx)
for around \$700, complete with a remote control seat lifter and self
cleaner. Not surprisingly, there were reports in January this year of
connected toilet hacking. According to the
UK's[Mirror](https://www.mirror.co.uk/tech/hackers-take-control-toilet-using-7342662)newspaper,

> "Researchers found that one of these high-tech toilets was protected
> with only a basic password. This meant they could take control of the
> toilet, allowing them to flush it at an awkward moment or even
> surprise people by unexpectedly aiming a jet of water at their nether
> regions".

Not all that smart really.
