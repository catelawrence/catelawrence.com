It's plain to see that emerging technology has changed the retail
experience beyond recognition.

We can shop on the internet anywhere, and at any time, without a
physical cash transaction and have it delivered to us in what can feel
like the blink of an eye. In times where retail fashion can be bought in
seconds and free returns mean that your apartment can be an at-home
changing room, I was interested to talk last week to Healey Cypher,
co-founder and CEO of [Oak](https://www.oaklabs.is/) and creator of a
hardware enabled platform that uses mirrors as a conduit to transform
the retail experience.

Oak has creating the Oak Mirror, a connected device that turns the
bricks-and-mortar retail experience into one that is closer in reality
to what we have come accustomed to online. Cypher reminded me that while
it's easy to do your shopping online, it still only accounts for a small
amount of all retail sales:

> "In-store sales are still up to 95% of all retail experiences and
> e-commerce is less than 7% of all retail transactions. Retail is a
> \$12 trillion industry that employs a quarter of the people in the US.
> and accounts for 50% of  expenditure of disposable income."

It is an sector that Cypher is passionate about, particularly in regard
to improving the customer experience. Usually trying on clothing means
stumbling around a store semi-dressed to find a different size or
dealing with the ministrations of an overeager sales attendant who whips
back the curtain to catch you in your...unawares.

But Oak wants to make that a thing of the past.

They currently have embedded their technology in a range of Ralph Lauren
stores in the US. All in-store items are connected to it with RFID
chips. This means an almost self-curated shopping  experience. Any
clothes you select to try on appear on a connected touch screen which is
part of the dressing room mirror. Need a new size or a different color?
Just tap the screen and a store assistant - each outfitted with a
corresponding iPad - brings you your choice. The screen also offers you
styling recommendations based on what's available in store and you can
email your selection to yourself for future consideration.

For those a little more discerning, the mirror even offered a variety of
lighting experiences: Fifth Avenue Daylight, East Hampton Sunset and
Evening at The Polo Bar.

It's easy to dismiss such notions as gimmick but the reality is that Oak
see the benefits of their platform far beyond novelty factors.

> "The RFID gives perfect data. This means stores can always know what's
> in stock at a glance, including size and colors. The average industry
> inventory accuracy is 65% in retail. It also enables buyers to see
> what other people bring into the fitting room and what items they are
> buying together. You learn whether certain items are always tried in
> one size but bought in another or tried but never purchased".

All of which is especially important for fashion houses, especially
those that stock "fast fashion," defined as fashion cycles of six weeks
or less.

Cypher admits that fashion is a traditional industry that has in some
respects been slow to adopt technology. Two of the leading reasons he
attributes this to are generational norms - "Younger, digital natives
are more likely to adopt this technology than older store owners" - and
also the difficulty in "getting retailers uses to expending capital on
technology. They are more likely to see the value in expenditure on
their front of house signage."

Yet, as Cypher notes, "consumers want things fast, easy, beautiful,
robust and personal." This will be the reality of retail fashion, and
Oak is keen to be part of this innovation, blurring the boundaries
between the digital and physical retail experience.
