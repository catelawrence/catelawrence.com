Getting into the smart home hardware business, today Google
debuted [Google Home](https://home.google.com/), a voice-activated home
automation system, at the firm's annual developer's conference, [Google
I/O 2016](https://events.google.com/io2016/).

We've had a few teasers over the last few months
and [Recode](https://www.recode.net/2016/5/11/11658432/google-chirp-amazon-echo-rival) previously
reported that Google has been working on a portable speaker containing a
built-in voice-activated assistant for the whole family in a prototype
called "Chirp."

Mario Queiroz, VP of product management, introduced Google Home, stating
that it "lets you enjoy music and entertainment, manage every day tasks
and *Ask Google* what you what to do, via a voice assistant." It's
preceded by the firm's Chromecast product, one that enables consumers to
play music videos and movies from a small device to the big screen.

Home automation space getting crowded
-------------------------------------

Google home is also Wi-Fi speaker that streams music directly from the
cloud for clear playback via verbal request or through Google. Consumers
will be able to request music in specific rooms or request multi-room
playback.

Queiroz unveiled a video displaying the possibilities of using Google
Home for requests like checking for flight delays to rebooking
restaurants to answering homework questions, demonstrating the growing
reality that there's no need for kids to talk to their parents ever
again.

It'll not only answer your queries and organize your life, Google Home
promises to connect your other smart home devices: lights, thermostat,
switches and - of course - Google's own Nest devices, with Querioz
predicting that in the future it will control things beyond the home,
via the voice assistant function.

IoT developer Qiming Fang said Google Home looks familiar. "To be
honest, from the demo, [I don’t really see it as that different from
(Amazon's) Echo," he said. "I think the developer community   - and
Google or Amazon’s ability to react quickly and revamp their APIs - will
be the key to which product ends up taking off."]{.s1}

He also noted that there was only a cursory mention of how Google Home
will connect with products such as Nest:

> "[If Nest can detects something out of the ordinary, Google Home could
> potentially also be used as a warning system. Multiple devices cold
> also ]{.s1}[create a network of warning systems, ]{.s1}[like if one
> person’s kitchens lights on fire by accident, neighboring homes could
> be warned."]{.s1}

This device will be a considerable competitor to Amazon's Alexa,
launched in 2015. Apple, Microsoft and Google all have voice-activated
assistants, but up until now, they've been limited to mobile devices.

Google may be announcing the feature today  to enable developers to
start building apps and integrations for the platform before its
physical launch. At any rate, it will be a key component of Google's
assistant ecosystem and evidence suggests there's more to come.
