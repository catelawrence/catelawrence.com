The technological advances inherent in the Internet of Things (IoT) are
providing researchers, town planners, ecologists and scientists with new
ways to not only prevent, but also solve, environmental problems - -
from [toxic water
supplies](https://readwrite.com/2016/04/20/buddy-iot-impact-solve-flint-water-crisis-il4/)
to [reducing climate change in rural
areas](https://readwrite.com/2016/04/29/internet-of-things-climate-change-cl4/).
Here are some of ways IoT is bringing sustainability:

\#1. Reducing e-waste
---------------------

![3015164\_6e979e27](rw-import/3015164_6e979e27.jpg){.wp-image-2075
.aligncenter width="566" height="418"}

The problem of e-waste is familiar to anyone with old devices. Once a
device becomes obsolete or beyond repair, it invariably ends up in
landfill, often in another country. While there have been schemes to
[refurnish
phones](https://www.zoo.org.au/get-involved/act-for-wildlife/theyre-calling-on-you)
and
[computers](https://www.apple.com/shop/browse/home/specialdeals/mac), the
sheer scale of e-waste is a complex problem. Many sustainability experts
have suggested that the tech industry should take some responsibility as
the enablers of the problem in the first place, and through this
process, the notion of [the circular
economy](https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/circular-economy) has
grown. A circular economy is characterized as one that "is restorative
and regenerative by design and which aims to keep products, components
and materials at their highest utility and value at all times."

[Project
Mainstream](https://www.weforum.org/reports/project-mainstream-global-collaboration-accelerate-transition-towards-circular-economy) is
global project targeting areas of sustainability thwarted by
complexities such as e-waste, using a circular economy model. As
connected devices are embedded with chips and sensors, they can be
tracked throughout their life cycles. In the future, this means that
consumers will be notified when older products can be repaired or
refurbished. If a device is returned to the manufacturer   - as an
alternative to disposal - the sensors will signal which components can
be repurposed or reused. One
example, [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/think/2016/04/22/circular-economy-earth-day/) is
working to keep industrial products in continuous loops to maximize
residual value and ensure that end-of-lease and client-owned IT
equipment is refurbished, resold, disassembled or sold as parts, to be
used for repair and maintenance work.

\#2. Tracking endangered species
--------------------------------

IoT technology has enabled scientists, conservationists and citizen
scientists to track and quantify endangered species through an increased
ability to collect, transmit, store and share data. In the Phillipines,
dugongs are photographed by local fishermen then uploaded to a central
database. The fishermen, many of whom are unable to read or write, are
being trained to use the smartphones and are being provided with local
charging facilities. The tracking enables conservationists to lobby for
appropriate sea protections where dugongs are situated.

In Australia honey bees are fitted with tiny micro censors by the
[CSIRO](https://www.csiro.au/en/Research/BF/Areas/Protecting-Australias-agricultural-industries/Robot-technology/Swarm-sensing) to
monitor bee movements. The research is being led by CSIRO and aims to
improve honey bee pollination and productivity on farms, as well as help
understand the drivers of bee Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD), a
condition decimating honey bee populations worldwide. The sensors are
tiny radio frequency identification sensors that work in a similar way
to a vehicle's e-tag, recording when the insect passes a particular
checkpoint. The information is then sent remotely to a central location
to help scientists increase their knowledge of bee migration. The
censors have also been trialled in Brazil and are predicted to work well
in remote locations, particularly when the sensors will be able to
generate power from insect movement and store energy in batteries.

\#3. Fighting deforestation
---------------------------

The use of drones to [monitor
deforestation](https://www.treehugger.com/gadgets/conservationists-launch-cheap-drone-monitor-deforestation-and-endangered-species.html)
is nothing new, but U.K.-based company [BioCarbon
Engineering](https://www.biocarbonengineering.com/) is working to use
drones in the fight against deforestation. In an effort to plant a
billion trees a year, drones take detailed 3D images of the landscape to
determine the nutrients, biodiversity and topology. This is followed by
a precision planting pattern where the drone fires a biodegradable seed
pod at each position, each containing nutrients for healthy tree growth.
While the program is still in planning stages, it has potential to
provide fast and accurate reforestation.

In many tropical countries, there's a thriving black market for
illegally cut timber. [Earth
Observation](https://www.earthobservation.com/what-we-do-1), a provider
of forest and marine monitoring solutions, has developed an infrared and
GPS-based system that creates a unique biometric record of individual
trees that have been legally authorized for harvest and uses a
smartphone app to transmit data to a tracking system. The system is
designed to circumvent opportunities for bribes and falsification of
data that allow the trade in illegally cut timber to flourish. Using
proprietary algorithms, TreeTAG generates a one-time code that captures
precise data on the potential maximum yield of each tree, as well as the
species, time, date, and exact location where each tree is felled. If a
tree is cut outside of a government-authorized logging concession, the
system will not generate a “tag.”

\#4. Monitoring the oceans
--------------------------

Where you start thinking about the internet in the ocean you know the
possibilities of technology are getting very big. [Catalina Sea
Ranch](https://www.catalinasearanch.com/Catalinasearanch.com/Monitoring.html)
is an America's first off shore shellfish ranch. Besides fishing, they
are also working on creating a wireless data capturing system for the
ocean.

As CEO Phil Cruver
[explains](https://agfundernews.com/how-to-build-a-data-capturing-internet-of-things-for-the-ocean5478.html):

> "[The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
> Integrated Ocean Observation System](https://www.ioos.noaa.gov/) (IOOS)
> provided a NOMAD buoy that will be anchored at our ranch and equipped
> numerous marine embedded sensors at strategic positions in the
> horizontal and vertical water plane. The wireless sensor network will
> help generate continuous real-time data, which will be transmitted to
> the cloud for remote and independent analysis by research institutions
> and to offer insights for offshore aquaculture operations."

In Italy, researchers at [SUNRISE](https://fp7-sunrise.eu/index.php) are
also working to enable seas, lakes and rivers to be digital highways for
data transfer from sensors, robots, and underwater vehicles capable of
performing tasks too dangerous for humans. These include environmental
monitoring   - both shallow and deep water - as well as border control
and protection of offshore critical infrastructures, de-mining,
surveillance and protection of submerged archaeological sites.  Efforts
include an underwater communication system based on acoustic waves,
which can travel tens of kilometres under water. It's a long-term,
complex and cross-collaborative protect that, if successful, will
revolutionize our understanding of the ocean as we know it.
