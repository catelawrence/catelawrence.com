It seems that every day a new IoT device or means to connect existing
devices is revealed. With so much energy in being devoted to tell us
how, when, where, what we can connect to each other, the “why” may be
getting a little blurry. So we want to take a step back every now
and[take a critical
look](https://readwrite.com/2016/05/01/best-and-worst-iot-week-vr1/) at
the connected devices that actually go out and buy, right now.

*(Ed note: We also do a [round-up of
crowdfunding](https://readwrite.com/2016/04/24/crowdfunding-iot-projects-watch-week-dl1/) ideas
you can’t quite get yet…or possibly should never be able to
get.) *Here’s what caught our eye, for all the right – or wrong –
reasons:

Smiirl's social media counter
-----------------------------

Some people need regular validation. They stare in the mirror and think
"But do people really like me?" If such people started a business, this
would be the product for them, [a visual counter by
Smiirl](https://www.smiirl.com/en/)displaying their company's number of
Twitter, Facebook or Instagram likes. As the company explains:

> <div>
>
> "Place it in your window to attract new customers, hang it on a wall
> to convince them to join your community, or even in your offices to
> motivate your teams!"
>
> </div>

> <div>

> </div>

[It'll put you back \$300 per counter and you'll need one for each
social media platform. Sit and watch your popularity drop. **Verdict:
Miss.**]{style="line-height: 1.5;"}

The Smart Zabuton
-----------------

![4](rw-import/4.jpg){.wp-image-2120
.aligncenter width="589" height="423"}

For cafe staff too busy staring at the social media counter to notice
that their customers have moved from their seats, there is the [Smart
Zabuton](https://www.keyvalue.jp/?stage=press_smartchair), a cushion with
that emits a signal when sat on (no, not like a whoopie cushion). This
allows cafe staff to use the corresponding app to check how many seats
are free in a cafe or restaurant. I guess it could come in handy if you
are managing an event like a public awards ceremony that requires [seat
fillers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seat_filler). It could also be
used at work by a controlling boss to see how long you spend sitting at
your desk. **Verdict: Miss.**

my.Flow
-------

![0320000008445374-photo-my-flow](rw-import/0320000008445374-photo-my-flow.jpg){.wp-image-2184
.aligncenter width="639" height="388"}

Did you know someone has made a smart tampon? You seem shocked. Anyway,
the[my.flow](https://www.trackmyflow.com/) notifies the wearer when it
needs to be changed. It works via a long tampon string that reaches out
of your underwear and attaches to a snap-on bluetooth sensor. This
bluetooth sensor can then be clipped on to your waistband.This sensor
then sends data to an app on your phone, analyzing how saturated the
tampon has become and alerting the wearer when they need to swap out
their tampon for a new one. While it's commendable that the makers are
aiming to solve the serious problem of [toxic shock
syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxic_shock_syndrome) and blood
leakages onto clothing, I'm not convinced that this is the way.

The company is currently seeking funding with the intention to sell the
sensor for a one-time price of \$49. I'm genuinely amazed how many
prizes this product has won, especially when more technology is
addressing the problem in innovative ways like [high tech absorbent
underwear](https://www.dearkates.com/pages/technology-new). It's also
reminiscent of the [Pro-pregnancy
tracker](https://readwrite.com/2016/01/08/ces-2016-misses/) in being a
rather redundant means to solve an issue. **Verdict: Miss.**

Triby
-----

Mobile phones are not conducive to the kitchen environment. I'm a keen
cook and often find myself unable to answer the phone due to fingers
encased with dough. I've also had the unpleasant experience of dropping
a mobile in a sink full of water from an apron product while teaching a
class. The Triby by [Invoxia](https://www.invoxia.com/) comes to
my rescue.

<div>

Triby is a digital assistant, Internet radio, connected speaker,
hands-free speakerphone, and connected message board all rolled into
one. Amongst other things, people can send messages, emoji and hand
drawn doodles to Triby ’s E-Ink display via its dedicated app. In April
it was the first non-Amazon product to be
[Alexa-enabled](https://readwrite.com/2016/05/11/amazon-alexa-packages-il4/)which
means that users customers have hands-free voice control for information
from Wikipedia and the web, weather, timers and alarms, news,
shopping/to-do lists, sports updates and scores, smart home features,
calendar entries, IFTTT, and much more—with new skills being added every
week. It retails at \$199 and I suspect it won't be long before cheaper
versions hit the market but with less sensitivity. **Verdict: Hit.**

Bitlock
-------

![yellow](rw-import/yellow.png){.wp-image-2168
.aligncenter width="593" height="631"}\
As a person who loses keys more often than I'd like to admit, this
product is very appealing. I also live in Berlin, where bike thefts are
a huge problem - thieves literally go around with cutters and steal
enough bikes to fill a truck.  [BitLock](https://bitlock.co/) is made of
reinforced and heat-treated steel combined with a high-security disc
locking mechanism. The lock is not only keyless but it's corresponding
app enables users to transfer pin number access to friends or visitors.
The battery lasts five years and a GPS connection to your mobile ensures
that you don't lose your bike after one too many beers. And if your
phone is dead, you can open BitLock by punching in a four-digit secret
code with a sequence of button presses. It costs \$129 which is
considerably more than a key lock but would be a good investment.
**Verdict: Hit.**

BMW Motorcycles' Emergency Call
-------------------------------

![P90217584-lowRes](rw-import/P90217584-lowRes.jpg){.wp-image-2123
.aligncenter width="533" height="377"}\
In a serious motor vehicle accident, it's vital to get help as soon as
possible. BMW is introducing the intelligent eCall system, which
is either automatically or manually triggered and sends out the position
data - the coordinates of the motorcycle accident site - to a qualified
BMW Call Center to initiate the rescue chain. In the “intelligent
emergency call” option, the connection is established via the
permanently installed mobile communication unit. Sensors on the
motorcycle detect which event occurred whether a collision with another
vehicle or crashing into an obstruction. A banking angle sensor detects
which position the motorcycle is in.

The intelligent emergency call takes three scenarios into account:
Automatic triggering in the case of a bad fall / collision; automatic
triggering in the case of a minor fall or collision (which the rider has
the option to cancel the call by pressing a button); and manual
triggering by pressing the SOS button for other road users in need. A
message is sent to the BMW Call Center and a voice connection is
established. A voice connection is mandatory if the eCall was triggered
manually before further measures are initiated. Here, too, the accident
victim/rider is also given the opportunity to cancel the emergency call
at the press of a button or by turning off the ignition.

I'm curious about the "intelligent emergency call system" how the rider
can communicate with the BMW Call Center in his native language.
Presumably in the future the call could go directly to emergency
services? It would be great to see this kind of technology embedded in
all kinds vehicles, including farm machinery like tractors.
