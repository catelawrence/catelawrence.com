New industry research from [Icontrol
Networks](https://www.icontrol.com/), the company behind the most
widely-distributed connected home platform in the industry, has found
exceptionally high satisfaction amongst customers who opted for a
professionally installed smart home solution.

Icontrol Networks' DIFM ("Do it for me") Smart Home Survey revealed more
than 96 percent of respondents report they are very satisfied or
satisfied with their systems. Beyond satisfaction, those with
professionally-installed solutions feel the cost is justified -
approximately 96 percent said they would purchase their systems again
and 98 percent would still opt for professional installation today.

The research surveyed 552 respondents across seven branded smart home
solutions – including solutions powered by Icontrol Networks as well as
other technology providers. Admittedly it's a relatively small subject
sample, but the results are unusually positive suggesting a high degree
of satisfaction in smart home products.

The report also found that security and peace-of-mind reign supreme
during the decision making process and are top motivating factors for
customer retention, with general security concerns and specific security
events being the top reasons most people purchase a system in the first
place.

DIY could mean missing out on some features
-------------------------------------------

While 98 percent of respondents said their systems were easy to learn
and use, most are still using their systems for single-device control
instead of whole home automation where devices work together seamlessly.
And although all providers mentioned in the survey offer systems with
scheduling or automation features, only 29 and 35 percent of respective
users thought their solutions offered these features, pointing to a lack
of awareness around the offering.

While less than a quarter of respondents installed third-party devices,
those that did were most likely to install smart thermostats, smart
garage doors and Amazon Echo.

Most customers who purchased a smart home system were already
proactively looking for a system, but when it came to picking a
provider, reputation proved to matter.  When asked why they chose their
service provider, more than half (60%) cited the reputation of the
company. When evaluating systems, most went to websites (72%) or
recommendations by family/friends  (51%), and 43% found more information
via advertising.

What DIYers found most difficult
--------------------------------

When asked about difficulty of usage, most customers reported setting
alerts, schedules and automation rules as the most difficult features of
the system to use.  This is interesting considering how many systems
there are to connect multiple devices, does it mean that a fully
connected home is more accessible to the DIY home installer than those
who opt for professionally installed system?  It suggested in the first
instance, that there is a need for professionally installed providers to
take time (possibly on an ongoing basis) to educate customers on the
possibilities.

Customers are relying on materials supplied by service providers (both
printed and online) to learn the system, which indicates the importance
for companies to develop appropriate education documentation. The data
also shows that once customers have had their system for some time, they
turn to customer support to troubleshoot proving that a knowledgeable
tech support team is invaluable.

Most customers printed instructions (59%) to learn their systems, as
well as the online user guide (54%).When it comes to troubleshooting
issues, customers overwhelmingly relied on customer service/technical
support (76% of total). This demonstrates that there is a need for
clear, ongoing training and support for consumers in the smart home
market.
