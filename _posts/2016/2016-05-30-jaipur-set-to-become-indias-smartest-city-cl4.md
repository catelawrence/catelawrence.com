In January this year, India's central government announced the first
list of 20 cities that have been identified for development as smart
cities, part of government plans to develop 100 Smart Cities by the end
of 2022.

The plans came about in part, via the [Smart Cities
Challenge](https://www.smartcitieschallenge.in/challenge-overview) funded
by Bloomberg Philanthropies. The Government of India launched this
challenge as a selection process to distribute central government
funding to 100 cities over three years.

However it would be a misnomer to assume that smart city development in
India is only in it's elementary stages. Since 2014 Cisco have been
involved in consulting with local government and development authorities
to bring connected capabilities to cities like Hamburg, Barcelona and
Adelaide.

Last week Cisco announced the city of Jaipur, Rajasthan - a city of 3.5
million residents and over 40 million tourists visiting annually - will
be the first Smart+Connected Community "Lighthouse City" in South Asia.

Under the consulting guidance of Cisco, the [Jaipur Development
Authority](https://jda.urban.rajasthan.gov.in/content/raj/udh/jda---jaipur/en/home.html)(JDA)
is focused on developing smart city infrastructure in Jaipur to
transform itself into a digital city of the future.

We spoke to Mr. Shikhar Agrawal, Commissioner, Jaipur Development
Authority,** **Government of Rajasthan and Shri Arijit
Banerjee,** **Principal Officer on Special Duty to Chief Minister,
Government of Rajasthan.

The project has been broken down into two phases so far, as Mr Agrawal
explained:

> " The first phase was about creating digital infrastructure to offer
> citizens amenities including interactive, intelligent kiosks and
> wireless broadband. The kiosks enable people to book transport, find
> shopping locations, find their way around, and we also have set up
> spaces for free mobile phone recharging. These are all especially
> useful in the tourist areas. We're the first city in the country to
> have 30 public wifi portals. We make these viable by being free up to
> a certain point and once a person reaches the paid point, the money
> earned goes back into funding the free service
>
> We've also made it possible that public services like hospitals and
> education providers now have extensive Wi-Fi."

The benefits of a connected city also extend to broader issues of public
safety, as Mr. Agrawal discussed:

> "Safety and security are a big part of our work including  video
> surveillance for public safety and security at key locations such as
> train stations. This includes safety mechanisms  such as an alarm if
> there was an unattended bag on a platform or a crime was in
> occurrence.
>
> We've also set up a City Infrastructure Management Centre (CIMC) and a
> Response Control Room to manage the city with greater efficiency...
> nearly all the solutions are integrated into a digital platform. The
> digital platform  can aggregate data from various sensors and
> solutions and conduct data analytics."

We were curious to know if they had attained direction or best practice
strategies from other connected cities. Mr. Banerjee countered that
idea:

> "We didn’t have any blueprint, we are learning as we go. I don’t think
> any city has a perfect end-to-end solution. Jaipur probably stands out
> as the city with the most number of initiatives cutting across areas
> of urban management. Jaipur is the blueprint that will guide other
> parts of India."

The second phase of the project will move into broader areas of the
city, according to Mr. Banerjee:

> "We have identified 5,000 light poles that we want to make 'smart' so
> they are programmable and remotely controllable. They will have an
> integrated video camera and be connected to the control and command
> center. We're also working on the area of waste management so that we
> can automatically know when public bins need to be emptied via a
> sensor between the bins and the garbage trucks. We also want to be
> able to water leakages and better manage water maintenance."

Cisco also announced   - in collaboration with Qualcomm Technologies
Inc., General Electric and 3M India Ltd. - the launch of an "Innovation
Centre" in Jaipur to help accelerate co-innovation of  IoT-based
solutions.

This center will team up with startups, developers, government agencies,
and academic communities who share the same goal of bringing innovative
ideas to life.

"A smart city of Jaipur enables good governance, a better quality of
life and increased employment opportunities for citizens," said Mr.
Agrawal.
