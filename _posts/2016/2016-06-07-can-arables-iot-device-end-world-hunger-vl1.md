In a time of technological, medical and social advances, it's hard to
believe that [795 million
people](https://links10.mixmaxusercontent.com/XafWjr8ju5wrdG5KS/l/0yMMDit5QVz5CZFlf?messageId=4wstgyhabwbdfS9F1&rn=&re=gIt92YuwWah12ZAVGdhNmLz1mI) still
go hungry around the world. When we learned from one new concept that
data acquired through an IoT device could end this, our interest is
piqued.

[Arable](https://arable.com/) has created PulsePod, an IoT device capable
of measuring more about the environment than any other connected device
in the world and can provide insight into crop health for the first time
in history.

Arable was founded by Adam Wolf, a scientist with a Masters in Agronomy.
Prior to Arable, he worked in one of the most remote and poverty
stricken parts of the world, working with the Kazakhstan government to
mitigate extreme weather and climate change. He believes the way we’re
going to end hunger is by using data - - so he went to Princeton, built
the PulsePod and garnered \$4 million in funding from the National
Science Foundation, and launched Arable shortly after that.

I spoke to Wolf about Arable this week:

How Arable and the PulsePod helps
---------------------------------

The PulsePod features a six-band spectrometer, four-way net radiometer,
and acoustic rain gauge that measures more than 40 observation streams
including rain, hail, canopy leaf area, crop water demand, environmental
stresses, microclimate, and even air pollution. It's always on and
always connected **** (built-in bluetooth, wifi, and cellular). It's
built for security (military grade encryption), flexibility (an API to
plug the data into existing platforms), and control (customers choose
how/when/what data to share).

Arable comes with a staff of hardware alumni: their industrial designer
developed the Go Pro camera, their mechanical engineer did the design
for Fitbit, and their electrical engineer developed the world’s first
headset so they’re working with people that are focused around making
things small and scientifically rigorous.

Wolf explained that PulsePod enables unprecedented visibility for what's
happening in the field and "for the first time we see farmers able to
manage the response of crops to the weather,  processors can predict
future yield so they can make marketing decisions, we start to see
insurance stepping in to cover risk for small holder agriculture, we
really see opening up for these parts of the market that are previously
inaccessible in terms of risk. This includes drought forecasting and
food security; forest and crop responses to weather and climate change;
and rural water usage.

Most data is generated in the US & Europe, while many applications are
in rural locales in the developing world. Cellular-based environmental
sensing promises to provide granular data in real time from remote
locales to improve model-based forecasting using data assimilation.

Wolf noted that weather and crop conditions are not measured in many
developing countries. "We have been working with the Met service for
Paraguay, up until now they have no weather stations,  only  a radar
system for the capital Asunción, so when theres a flood it causes major
traffic jams and problems for residents, monitoring allows them  to have
real time granular information that can be pushed out to people so they
can react.

Even in New York City, weather tracking is needed in storm management:

> "The Mayor's Office contacted us because they have the potential to
> get floods, but the land underneath the pavement is so complicated
> that they don’t know how to connect the rainfall in Place A with where
> it's going to flood in Place B. Data enables them to work out where to
> begin, which storm drains to focus on, and how to have the biggest
> impact. Even in the U.S., we see a picture ranging from wheat
> production at \$500 an acre, to berry production at \$100,000 an acre.
> So we looked at those crops and said where do we even begin, what is
> the biggest possible opportunity for us to create a platform for other
> people to be answering questions in their place?"

Wolf discussed their experiences working with one of the world's largest
berry producers:

> "There's a gigantic need and desire in forecasting for specialist
> crops, this is one area where there's a gigantic need and a gigantic
> desire but really no tools up until now. It's been a problem as long
> as anyone can remember. They need to know how many berries are out
> there in the field to make marketing decisions. So four weeks prior to
> harvest they were  going out, counting green berries…and they sort of
> do a little bit of math and estimate how many berries they’re going to
> sell as a company. So in a given week you’re selling a million pounds
> of strawberries. That decision is made on counting perhaps 50 berries,
> and we realized each of those berries is worth a million dollars.

> If you counted more you should be marketing more, then they realize
> the week they harvest, 'Oh no, we actually have 1.2 million *tonnes*
> in strawberries' and you're faced with either selling for pennies or
> leaving them in the field to rot. This plays out consistently amongst
> speciality crops: they have no hedging, there's no exchange board, so
> they are highly exposed with very few tools up until now.

Agriculture is a sector that is greatly benefitting from innovative
technology, and Arable offer solutions to problems that have previously
seemed par for course. They may not end world hunger just yet, but
they'll certainly make strides in tackling the challenge. So far
partners include the U.S. Department of Energy, Jet Propulsion
Laboratory, U.S. Agency for International Development and Treasure Wine
Estates.
