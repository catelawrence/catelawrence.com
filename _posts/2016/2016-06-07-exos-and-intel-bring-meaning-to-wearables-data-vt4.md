Wearable devices and fitness programs share one thing in common: The
problem of stamina.

It's well established that while fitness programs and the wearing of
fitness wearables are enthusiastically embraced, both receive a drop-off
after three months or less.  This is compounded by the fact that, so
far, [there's been a proliferation of human performance data in the
market, but a lack of understanding about what the data means and what
to do with it. ]{.s1}

[[EXOS](https://www.teamexos.com/) is a human performance company that
trains elite athletes, such as the likes of Russell Wilson, Andrew Luck,
and German National Soccer team. They also conducted a study with the
U.S. national soccer team that investigated the [relationship between
sleep and
performance](https://sports.usatoday.com/2014/06/05/sleep-monitors-us-players-brazil/).
The company helps prepare hundreds of college players for the NFL every
year, and it built on this program by reaching a deal with the NFL
Players Association to provide lifestyle services to current and former
players that deal with health, wellness, and life after football.  They
also are heavily engaged in the development of corporate wellness
programs across a range of Fortune 500 companies. ]{.s1}

[Their roots ]{.s1}[lie in understanding sports performance and human
biomechanics through data – through groundbreaking scientific
methodology. ]{.s1}

[With that in mind, they announced a partnership with Intel in March
this year - - the first of its kind - - with the aims to:]{.s1}

-   [Track fitness data using Intel’s line of wearable products]{.s1}
-   [Provide actionable plans for consumers using the data and EXOS’
    methodology]{.s1}
-   [Analyze corporate wellness environments to correlate wellness and
    productivity]{.s1}

EXOS is currently launching new education courses designed for fitness
professionals, focusing on behavior upgrades and wearables data
collection. This includes the first in a series of EXOS Presents
courses, in collaboration with Intel, on wearables data. [The initial
course focuses on leveraging data to help facilitate
recovery](https://courses.teamexos.com/data-and-recovery/?utm_source=readwrite&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=pr).\

EXOS: Time to bring insight to data
-----------------------------------

I spoke to Craig Friedman, VP of Performance Innovation at EXOS, about
the program. He explained that the explosion of wearables on the market
meant that:

> "What used to be available in a research lab is now available on your
> wrist. The challenge is that data interest wears off if you don’t
> bring insight and context to it. We need to work on how should we be
> thinking, categorizing and leveraging data to bring insight, context
> and individualized prescriptions".

He also noted "the first step the industry hasn’t solved yet is creating
a device nod giving the user a reason to use it for more than three
weeks."

Many sports wearable companies focus their products on those already
interested in their physical fitness and quantified self whether elite
athletes or keen amateurs. Friedman also explained that measuring
performance can be relevant to all of us in different doses:

> "We can measure the athlete with the world record in broad jump-an
> example of total body power - but if we can’t generate enough power to
> stand out of our chair unassisted we can’t step off the toilet so our
> physical performance has a very real consequence on our quality of
> life."

Data is also used outside of fitness in many workplaces and homes and
could include for example, "the number of bugs per line of code or for a
parent the number of quality interactions with their child over a week."

The use of workplace wearables and the ability to collect meaningful
employee data has changed in purpose according to Friedman. I recall
last year ago there was a lot of attention focused on BP's distribution
of Fitbit fitness trackers to employees and their spouses with [activity
points earning staff discounts on their health insurance
premiums](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-33261116).  Friedman
stresses that there is a need to ensure that data focuses on a variety
of activities in an ongoing way with a consideration of the individual
beyond the quantified self, "Is  a healthier employee more happy, do
they have more energy, do they stay more engaged?  Do they enjoy their
job more?"

Whether such factors can truly be measured by wearable apps remains to
be seen but there's certainly plenty of people willing to try.
