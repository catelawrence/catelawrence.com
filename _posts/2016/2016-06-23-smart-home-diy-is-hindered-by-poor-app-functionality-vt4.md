In Argus Insights' newest "Smart Home 360" report, it's clear there's a
strong distinction between consumer perception of the apps associated
with the most popular Smart Home Service Providers and MSOs (Multiple
System Operators) and the apps coming with Do It Yourself (DIY) devices.

Argus Insights found that - - from over 56,000 app and device reviews
-- [ADT](https://www.adt.com/dallas?ecid=lmdallas&optimizely_disable=true)
and [Suddenlink](https://www.suddenlink.com/) are the least liked of MSOs
and service providers and their associated apps saw a drop in both the
tone and volume of feedback over the last month, an indication that
frustrated users could be moving to other providers.

This is consistent with [previous
research](https://readwrite.com/2016/05/24/professionally-installed-home-automation-diy-pt1/) that
demonstrates a high degree of satisfaction by customers in DIFM (“Do it
for me”) installations.

However, [Vivint’s Sky
app](https://support.vivint.com/product/skycontrol-mobile-app), Cox
Communications Homelife app, Xfinity Home app and Alarm.com app all
trended up - - an impact of both new releases and subscriber growth.

A functionality gap?
--------------------

The report reveals that the gap between consumer perception of the Smart
Home devices they install and the apps use to control them persists,
with the apps failing to deliver the promised functionality and
usability. Connectivity continues to be a key barrier to adoption for
most consumers, and home security continues to be the most discussed
usage scenario by consumers both in the review data and in the more
aspirational social conversations.

Users of the service provider apps that orchestrate their Smart Home
experience have, in the last few months, seen the experience improve
over the apps used to control those provided by device manufacturers
like Nest and Philips.

This suggests that those offering “Do It For Me” experiences, especially
after recent improvements by AT&T, Vivint, Comcast and others, are
beginning to best DIY experiences. This is mainly due to the fact that
DIY experiences are still plagued with connectivity issues bleeding over
from the initial installation of the devices in the home. Most of the
issues for MSO and Service Providers are related to software quality
issues such as app stability and constant bugs.

*See also: [Do we really want to DIY our home
automation?](https://readwrite.com/2016/05/24/professionally-installed-home-automation-diy-pt1/)*

However, both sets of users are frustrated with the performance of door
lock and entry monitoring controls of their apps, mainly due to
connectivity issues as data moves from door to gateway to cloud to phone
and back again in a complex handoff of command and control. Connectivity
issues like this can sometimes leave consumers fumbling for their keys
after trying to use their phone.

Consumers are still more concerned about asset protection than having
purple mood lights in the kitchen. While Amazon’s Echo continues to
dominate as the most popular interface to the Smart Home, many consumers
are still waiting to see if and when Apple starts to make good on the
promise of HomeKit. T[he firm's recent announcements at WWDC makes us
hopeful.](https://readwrite.com/2016/06/15/apples-home-makes-great-strides-connect-world-iot-apple-products-pt4/)

Clearly there is a need for improvement in the home automation apps that
are the conduit to any smart home. Without this, consumer
dissatisfaction is sure to increase.
