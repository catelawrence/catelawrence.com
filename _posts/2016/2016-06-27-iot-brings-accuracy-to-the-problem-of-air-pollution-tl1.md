IoT is putting itself forward as a means of tackling one of the world's
biggest health problems: air pollution.

A problem that is not limited to developing countries but stills plagues
some of the biggest cities in Europe. Just last year the [UK High Court
ruled](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-35689427) that the government must
take action to cut pollution after being in breach of EU limits for
pollutants for several years with nitrogen pollution from diesel
vehicles a significant contributing factor.

IoT is playing a key role in measuring and mapping pollution levels,
with sensors and wearables used to record not only measurements but
physiological responses to them. Many of these tools are made accessible
to citizen scientists to create pollution maps within cities and are an
important tool in  documenting and leveraging health and environmental
data to inform public policy.

So here are some of the innovative technologists working hard in this
space:

Idea 1: Aircasting
------------------

![AirCasting-Pod-and-App](rw-import/AirCasting-Pod-and-App.jpg){.size-full
.wp-image-3598 .aligncenter width="600" height="425"}

AirCasting is an [open-source](https://github.com/habitatmap),
end-to-end solution for collecting, displaying, and sharing health and
environmental data using a smartphone. The platform consists of wearable
sensors that detect changes in your environment and physiology,
including a palm-sized air quality monitor called the
[AirBeam](https://www.takingspace.org/aircasting/airbeam/), the
[AirCasting Android
app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.llp.aircasting&hl=en),
the AirCasting website, and [wearable LED
accessories](https://www.instructables.com/id/AirCasting-LiteBeam/).

Interestingly, as addition to measuring environmental levels such as
Aircasting's wearable accessories can also measure the wearer's response
to the air pollution including their heart rate, heart rate variability
and breathing rate.

Idea 2: Airly
-------------

Poland-based startup [Airly](https://airly.pl/) is working on hardware
that measures pollution (e.g. dust sensors, forest fires detectors,
traffic management modules, water quality monitoring) so companies can
deliver global solutions for Smart Cities. Their idea originated due to
the founders' experiences the bad air of Krakow, considered the [most
polluted city in
Europe](https://energydesk.greenpeace.org/2015/06/25/polands-smog-crisis-europes-most-polluted-country-in-trouble-with-the-eu-but-wont-cut-coal-emissions/) due
to coal emissions.

It's a made-to-order product that may be in its early days - - but
instead of using Wi-Fi or GSM, it uses
[LoRa](https://www.lora-alliance.org/What-Is-LoRa/Technology) technology
to power its sensor technology. They're working with Cisco to include
environmental health as a just one of the data readings made possible in
smart city technologies being made available to city governments. This
startup is definitely one to watch.

Idea 3: Plumelabs
-----------------

![CdhVm1HW4AAWzpK](rw-import/CdhVm1HW4AAWzpK-1.jpg){.size-full

In March this year, Paris based
startup [Plumelabs](https://www.plumelabs.com/) set free a small flock
of racing pigeons through London wearing pollution-sensing backpacks for
three days to monitor the city's air pollution levels, particularly
nitrogen dioxide and ozone gases - - produced mainly by diesel vehicles
- - and reporting the results on Twitter.

The campaign encourages Londoners to join the "Air Patrol" by becoming
beta testers for a wearable version of Plume Labs’ ultra-light air
pollution sensing device. A[crowdfunding
campaign](https://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/crowdsource-air-pollution-in-london)
aims at recruiting 100 beta testers in London to map out live air
pollutant levels across the city. These personal wearable sensors will
eventually complement Plume Labs’ flagship product, the Plume Air
Report, an urban weather forecast for air pollution that tracks air
pollution levels in 300 cities and 40 countries thanks to open data.

The free mobile app, available on iOS and Android, uses artificial
intelligence and machine learning techniques to provide live pollution
forecasts and advice on what to do to avoid over-exposure to
environmental factors such as UV or air pollutants.\

The data collection of pollution levels is only one tool in creating a
reduction of pollution in the cities of Europe. The introduction of laws
to reduce the reliance on old technologies is one way to create this
incentive to boost new technologies that remove pollutants from the
atmosphere. Electric cars are one example of this technology, yet their
adoption needs to move beyond financial incentives.

Some researchers cautiously claim that [driverless cars will reduce
pollution](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/driverless-cars-may-slow-pollution/),
with others cite [the popularity of the Tesla
3](https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/may/07/tesla-3-electric-car-affordable-worth-price)as
an example that electric cars can be a viable consumer option. With all
this innovation, it will be interesting to see if and how pollution
levels changes over the next decade.
