It's not often you hear of a start-up product that emerged from a
student working in a car factory. But ProGlove's co-founder Paul GÃ¼nther's foray into the startup world
was preceded by employment at BMW. During his studies, he was in touch
daily with workers on the factory floor. One thing was clear - -
everyone wore gloves and if these gloves could be made intelligent, they
could assist the worker to make their job easier.
