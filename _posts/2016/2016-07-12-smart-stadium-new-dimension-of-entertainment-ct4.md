In an era where sporting games can be beamed into one's home via tv or
internet subscription with curated footage without the need to battle
car parking, queues, expensive tickets, unhealthy fast food or poor
viewing seats, it's clear that sports stadiums need to offer something
radical to entice fans away from their home comforts. Stadiums around
the world are stepping up to the plate to provide  superior services to
both fans, players and staff through connected technology.

Here are some examples:

The rise of the Connected Stadium
---------------------------------

![sports](rw-import/article-1284597-0AF89E3B000005DC-158_468x286-1.jpg){.size-full

The "Connected Stadium" is a concept where stadiums facilitate the
audience's ability interact online from within the stadium, and within
this to interact with the online community whether via tablet or mobile.
To achieve this, stadiums are increasingly committed to providing fast,
reliable WiFi to enable fans to engage with their broader social media
connections.

Finding a parking space and the right entrance to your seat can be
difficult at a new stadium. There's now a suite of apps, including [Just
Park](https://www.justpark.com/uk/parking/broadfield-stadium/), that
sell parking spaces and guide you not only to the stadium but your seat.

Fans no longer need to jostle overfilled cups of beer and messy hot dogs
between the kiosk and your seat, risking a spill with every step. Many
stadiums have rolled out [mobile point of service
systems](https://www.emobilepos.com/solutions/stadium-arena-pos/) to
enable fans to buy food, beverages, merchandise and team
memberships [without even leaving their
seat](https://www.bypassmobile.com/) through a combination of mobile and
beacon technology.

It not only saves time, but also lowers staffing needs. Along with
merchandise, sports stadiums an also make extra money through the
up-selling of seats through the use of seat upgrade apps such as
[Pogoseat](https://www.pogoseat.com/) which enable fans to move to seats
closer to the action during the game for a price which reduces as the
game progresses.  Geomapping also helps provide fans with information
via mobile app on the nearest bathrooms and the expected wait time.

Cisco's real-time live feeds
----------------------------

Cisco's [StadiumVision](https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en_us/solutions/industries/docs/sports/broncos-sports.pdf)
initiative delivers real-time, live HD video from any source and can
include content from in-house feeds and external local and national
channels create an exciting, immersive experience for fans throughout
the venue. An example is the [Sports Authority
Field](https://www.sportsauthorityfieldatmilehigh.com/) at Mile High in
Denver which hosts 1,200 displays. Large video walls offer a lasting
impression and support complementary sidebar promotions and ads for the
local team, the Broncos. Fans can also access a range of tools such as
player profiles, statistical data and fantasy performances of teams on
their smart phones, tablets and stadium kiosks.

This has an add-on effect of servicing sponsors, says Brady Kellogg,
vice president of corporate partnerships for the Broncos:

> “In addition to keeping our fans engaged in all of the action
> throughout the stadium, we have so much more to offer sponsors. Now we
> can offer segmentation opportunities for advertisers, sponsors,
> concessionaires, and merchandising partners. Sponsors can reach a
> broader range of people through more brand touch points and tailor
> specific messages to specific levels of fans.”

Getting to know your fans
-------------------------

Smart stadiums can personalize the fan experience through [loyalty
programs](https://www.rippleffect.com/news-views/the-connected-stadium-what-can-football-learn-from-erm-football/)
based on their purchase history and through data analytics software that
is used to predict future behavior - - what they buy and when. Retail
franchises can maximize on this information as they are able to
communicate with fans from the time of their arrival and during the
game, during which they can send targeted ads and personalized
messaging.

Goal-line technology  is an integral part of match officiating at smart
stadiums and is used in events such as the [2016 Euro
Cup.](https://www.uefa.org/mediaservices/mediareleases/newsid=2354960.html) One
example is the the
[Hawk-Eye](https://www.hawkeyeinnovations.co.uk/sports/football) system
that deploys seven cameras per goal, using control software to track the
ball within the goal area. Using vision-processing techniques and
software, Hawk-Eye indicates whether or not a goal has been scored
within one second with a vibration and visual signal on each match
official's watch. This is supplemented by an extra official behind each
goal-line.

Stadium crowd management
------------------------

Smart stadiums can also benefit staff and officials through[accurate
real time
data](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ibm/2015/05/04/how-smart-digital-stadiums-are-changing-the-way-we-watch-sports/#57787cf4c1c2)
such as the number of people present and their locations, tools that are
useful in case of an emergency or a missing child. Smart surveillance
can also be utilized to provide safety evacuation information such as
instructions and directions in the case of an emergency and analytics
can be coordinated with weather and traffic information outside of the
stadium. This means fans can leave happy, with the knowledge of their
fastest route home.

Attending a game is not a cheap activity. As more and more stadiums
embrace technology and the inevitable costs involved, the challenge will
be to mitigate the increased costs: would fans rather be saving money
for tickets if it means they are subject to constant marketing - -
personalized or otherwise?  Time will tell if stadiums are able to
balance the competing priorities of fans and marketers.
