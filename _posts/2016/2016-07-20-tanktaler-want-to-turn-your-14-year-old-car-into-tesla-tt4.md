It's easy with the evolution towards cars that are not only connected
but autonomous vehicles to forget that such technologically enhanced
vehicles are preceded by cars that have operated with perfect
functionality for many years despite their lack of technical prowess.

Up until now, the owners of such cars have been faced with two options:
remain "disconnected" or upgrade to a new car. Thanks to a Munich-based
IoT company called ThinxNet, car owners with model years from 2001
onwards can get some of the technological advances afforded to those
with newer car models.

The system is called [TankTaler](https://www.tanktaler.de/), and
includes a hardware dongle  - - which includes a SIM card and GPS
monitor - - and a corresponding smart phone app. The dongle plugs into
the [OBD II
interface](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/obd-ii-port-used/),  the port
located below the steering wheel that mechanics access to get diagnostic
information about your car.

Once paired with the app, the car owner can get a range of information
about the car, This includes battery and fuel levels, details of travel
routes and driving behaviour, anti-theft protection and more. We spoke
with Regina Werner at ThinxNet to learn more.\

TankTaler concept actually came from the farm
---------------------------------------------

TankTaler was launched in November 2015 after the ThinxNet founders
pivoted from their original plan to use GPS technology to track the
location of cow herd on large farms in the Alps or Argentina. The dongle
and app are free for participants who additionally earn bonus points
called TankTaler which can be redeemed in gift vouchers - - from gas
stations or retailers like Amazon around Germany with loyalty program
with cash-back system.

The TankTaler device offers a range of functionalities, that interest
different people in different ways.  Werner explained:

> "Some users want really simple features, for example, people who live
> in the cities often do not have a private parking lot, hence they
> spend hours looking for a place to park their car – and thus always
> park at different sites. Additionally, they often share cars. This
> means they never know where their car is parked. Then there's tech
> driven people  who are super interested in the statistics around the
> car such as the driving behaviour, how harsh they are breaking, how
> much they’re accelerating and the distances they’ve travelled. Then
> you have people that like using TankTaler as they like to save money".

Currently, they have about 25,000 customers, "the largest private fleet
in Germany," mainly in Munich and Cologne. They generate revenues
through partnerships with various companies including gas stations,
garages, car dealerships, restaurants and retail chains; McDonald's and
IKEA are both partners.

Discount benefits...and reclaiming your data
--------------------------------------------

That means TankTaler users get discounts and other benefits. You can
imagine there being some attractive connections with car insurances
also. However, ThinxNet's work is underpinned with the idea of personal
"sovereignty"*** ***over personal data. Werner notes that:

> "Right now most car manufacturers are collecting data without drivers
> being aware of it and trying to earn money out of it. We believe that
> drivers should own their data and decide what to do with it, according
> to what will directly benefit them".

It also benefits people who use their car for business. As Werner
explains:

> "When you use your car also for business you get tax deductions
> according to your mileage but you have to document your journey in a
> log book. Through TankTaler people can download all their trips as a
> spreadsheet. By comparison, a competitor's product offering only this
> feature costs over €700".

TankTaler also enables payments
-------------------------------

The dongle works without the need for a mobile phone connection. This
has meant that it is possible to track the cars location precisely and
get help in the event of a break down or accident as the device is
connected to an emergency call number. [This is akin to the functions of
the latest BMW
motorcycles](https://readwrite.com/2016/05/23/calm-cruel-connected-iot-hits-misses-may-vr1/) and
is expected to be made mandatory in all new cars by 2018.

ThinxNet are working to join forces with automobile clubs to enable the
tracking of broken down cars with the app able to send their precise
location. As the dongle has its own battery, it can send data even if
the dongle is removed by a car theft or the car battery gets
disconnected in the case of a crash.

Perhaps one of the most innovative uses of the TankTaler is in one touch
payments at gas stations. Users can fill up, tap the app, and get back
in their car. They are then sent a monthly bill to pay. This is very
innovative for Germany where you normally have to pay inside the shop
and many retailers favor cash over other payment methods. Werner notes:

> "Gas station owners are sometimes 60-plus (years old) and hard to
> explain the technology to, but when you show that people can pay
> through the app, people think that's really revolutionary. Some owners
> are like 'This is the biggest revolution in the last 40 years in the
> industry.'"

But perhaps some of the more indirect benefits of TankTaler are through
big data analysis.

The device has the potential to track large groups of drivers throughout
concentrated areas and thus is able to measure the popularity of driving
routes and determine weak spots where a road needs to be repaired or
there's a spot with high rates of accidents.

This could potentially include information for smart city planners such
as where to situate traffic lights and how to control them with the help
of real time data to get a smooth flow of traffic. It can also help
developers determine where gas stations should be built according to
traffic flow.

ThinxNet intends on branching up to other parts of Europe in the
upcoming months, paving the way for enter into other countries around
the world. The irony of such an enterprise as this is that as connected
cars become more normal, they will gradually be placing themselves out
of a job, but for now, that time is a long way off.
