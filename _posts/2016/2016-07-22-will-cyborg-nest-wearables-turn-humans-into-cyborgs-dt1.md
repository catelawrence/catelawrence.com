I am one of those people that firmly believes that implanted wearables
are the future of health technology. Devices like [cochlear
implants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochlear_implant) have been
around since the 1980s, [contraceptive
implants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etonogestrel_contraceptive_implant)
since the late 1990s and there are many other implanted medical devices
that add quality to life - - or even preserve life - - from hip
replacements to pacemakers.

However, outside of the medical world, implanted devices have been
limited to a DIY movement called biohacking, a form of self-health
monitoring which aims to take the expertise out of the hands of health
professionals and into the hands of individuals. The spectrum ranges
from the more benign exercise wearables to a range of DIY "body tools"
and regulators, like implanted biomagnets that can used to pick up small
items or an RFID chip to unlock your door or use the photocopier without
a PIN code.

Cyborg Nest resets your orientation
-----------------------------------

Cyborg Nest recently launched their first commercial product, North
Sense, a Bluetooth-enabled, thumbnail-sized embeddable piece of tech
that attaches to your body with a couple piercings and vibrates every
time it faces [magnetic
north](https://gisgeography.com/magnetic-north-vs-geographic-true-pole/).
The Cyborg Nest website couches their wearables in an unfortunately
"mystical" language which obscures the practical benefits of wearables
in everyday life for many people. Let's face it - - there are other more
appealing wearable devices than a compass for most people.

Once fitted, the company says, "you’re given back an ancient sense of
orientation, deeply rooted in our traditions, spiritual life and
history. You will own a unique new ability, and this will change you. In
a few months, as a cyborg, you’ll be able to experience new memories,
maps and life moments, created and influenced by a new layer—your North
Sense."

It all seems rather excessive for a mere compass that can't even unlock
a front door or connect to a map on an iPhone.

The FAQ section is also quite entertaining, as the creators answer the
question of how it will change people:

> "[This is not a physical change – this is a mind change. Processes
> take time, changing from person to person. Gradually, North Sense will
> become part of your existence. Your brain will learn how to filter the
> information, exactly as it’s filtering distractions right now as
> you're reading this sentence."]{.color_1}

North Sense seems tame compared to predecessors like the work
of [Grindhouse wetware](https://www.grindhousewetware.com/), a Pittsburgh
startup that created Northstar V1, an implanted wearable device,
pictured below, that gives wearers "the possibility of implanting
technology in the body and paves the way for more advanced and
functional augmentations."

They aim to follow with Northstar Version 2, a "rechargeable device that
adds gesture recognition and Bluetooth capabilities, enabling users to
control electronic devices with hand movements, as well as add patterns
or color variations to LED."

.aligncenter width="695" height="464"}

To be fair, there are different levels of comfort and acceptance when it
comes to notions of transhumanism, cyborgs and implanted wearables and
this is one of the few examples of a commercial wearable that goes
beyond being simply "worn."

You can pre-order North Sense now for \$367, with the initial 2,000
units expected ship in September. Beyond that, you'll have to wait for
the next [Biohacker Summit](https://biohackersummit.com/) in Helsinki or
liaise with [Dangerous Things.](https://dangerousthings.com/)
