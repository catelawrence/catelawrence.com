A recent
[report](https://www.citihorizons.com/resources/lucy-zodion-white-paper)commissioned
by streetlight design and manufacturing company
[Lucy Zodion](https://www.lucyzodion.com/) has found significant barriers
to smart city development in the UK.

The report contains research into the opinions on smart cities of senior
contacts from councils across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern
Ireland. The in-depth interviews conducted in May and June 2016 gauged
the appetite for smart cities among UK councils and opinions on a range
of topics, from the biggest obstacles to smart cities to the most
pressing priorities for councils.

It was revealed that the task of achieving smarter, more connected
cities in the UK lies with local councils. With the National
government’s drive for devolution, they are placing the responsibility
on the individual council to take the initiative when it comes to
improving their city.

Yet growing strains on public services and budgets could negatively
affect the ability of all councils to dedicate the resources required to
trial technology, progress smart projects, and identify the most
cost-effective path to prepare our cities for the future.

The research identified strong evidence for a lack of understanding
within councils from the outset; over 80% of the 187 councils did not
have an appointed lead for smart cities, and many confessed to a low
awareness of the topic and what it could mean for them. Common barriers
towards progression were identified, from securing funding and
resourcing at a time of budget cuts, to a lack of collaboration between
services and departments hindering progress.

Despite the acknowledgement that smarter solutions have the potential to
save money or streamline services, many councils less involved in smart
cities struggle to siphon budget away from core spending (largely health
and social care) and dedicate resources to progress smart cities
projects and invest in new initiatives.

Notably, those councils leading the way on smart cities were more likely
to have secured external funding – and those who were more advanced
along their smart journey and keen to progress further admitted to
having bid for funding but lost, or needing more funding to meet their
strategic aims.

> “We aren’t hindered by funding, we are finding it from Europe, the
> funding available by UK government in terms of super-fast broadband,
> and finding our own resources from government too.”

This is significant as the outcome of the [recent Brexit
referendum](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-32810887) may make UK
councils ineligible to receive EU funding.

UK projects need councils' buy-in
---------------------------------

Without sustainable funding in place, smart city projects are failing to
achieve internal buy-in, according to many councils. Research
participants were asked how high a priority smart cities were on their
council’s agenda. The overwhelming response was that, faced with budget
pressures and shrinking resources, finding internal buy-in to progress
with smart initiatives was an uphill struggle for many.

The downgrading of a smart transition as a priority for many local
councils was often pinpointed to a lack of evidence to support a
business case, particularly when funds are limiting and projects are
competing to secure what little there may be available. Whilst some
councils are enjoying the benefits of early implementation of new
technology, the vast majority have struggled to obtain results and proof
that would convince council leaders to divert funds to support new
initiatives.

> “A lot of the services that are provided in cities are privatised. The
> councils won’t benefit from the information that is derived from how
> people are using infrastructure, how they’re using leisure resources,
> how they’re using transport and so on. The council can’t actually do
> much with that apart from planning how the roads would work, how you
> know when development happens, most people who are going to benefit
> are the ones actually making money rather than spending it in cities
> and towns, and that would be businesses.”

The ability to apply Wi-Fi connections to street lamps in city centers
was the most cited example of a smart solution already rolled out in
cities. This was seen as immediately offering benefits to citizens in a
cost-effective way. Situated every 30 yards on roads and streets in
every city, lampposts are publicly owned, connected to an electricity
supply and, by their very nature, located in urban areas. Their height
makes them suited to radio communications, and smart technology is
already being developed for lamp posts, from air pollution sensors and
parking meters to improving security and energy efficiency with smarter
street lighting.

Without meaningful financial investment and local commitment is it
unlikely that many local councils will extend their smart city
development beyond them.
