News sites  and social media has been abuzz the last few days with the
situation that the[Petnet](https://www.petnet.io/) automated pet feeder
was experiencing [system
failure](https://twitter.com/petnetiosupport/status/758149586829529088) raising
significant questions about the reliability of connected devices.

The situation unfolded on Wednesday when angry PetNet owners posted a
email from Petnet to Twitter which advised them:

> "You may experience a loss of scheduled feeds and failed remote
> feedings. Please ensure that your pets have been fed manually until we
> have resolved this issue".

The [Petnet](https://www.petnet.io/)is a smart pet feeder with features
including "“intelligent sensor technology, learning algorithms, and
processing power that assesses the dietary requirements of a pet" and a
custom feeding schedule via a [corresponding
app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/petnet-mobile/id962239016?mt=8) with
alerts to pet owners when their pet has been fed and reminders when food
supplies are running low.  It's usage scenarios may include when an
owner is late home, wanting to avoid an early morning or of course on
holidays. Thus, it's understandable that pet owners have met the
situation with outrage.

According to PetNet’s CEO, Carlos Herrera, the third-party server
service, that the company rents from Google, had been down for around 10
hours and did not have redundancy backups, further claiming that PetNet
was preparing to roll out a workaround to the problem, as explained
to [The
Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/27/petnet-auto-feeder-glitch-google).
Herra further claimed that about 10% of PetNet users were affected, and
that the feeders can operate on previously set schedules without this
particular third-party service, though users lose the ability to feed
remotely or change the feeding schedule.

The rise of the connected pet

[Connected pets](https://readwrite.com/2016/03/03/pet-tech-love/) are
nothing new as the era of wearables and connected technology mean pet
owners are able to gain greater insight into the needs and health of
their furriest family members. Automated pet feeders of old are becoming
replaced by digitised versions that claim to (depending on brand) not
only supply feed and water on a regular basis but also check the
quantity of food and water consumed;  notify you when pet [food is
running low](https://getnibbles.com/); provide camera shots and video
footage of your pets; enable you to talk to your pet via your phone or
laptop and distinguish your cats from each other through [facial
recognition technology](https://catfi.com/pro.html). You can even get
specific [RFID tagged
devices](https://www.sureflap.com/en-us/pet-feeder/microchip-pet-feeder)
to stop your pets from stealing each others food. At any time there's an
abundance of pet products on the market including at the time of
writing, over 150 connected devices on Kickstarter seeking funds. But
until this week the notion of what happens when the technology fails,
placing our beloved pets potentially at risk has been notably absent.

Lessons from the PetNet's failure
---------------------------------

It's been a while since I heard the term *'internet of stupid'* but a
number of people on twitter have assigned it to the IoT sector in light
of this situation. Inherent with connected hardware design are possible
failure scenarios like problems with internet connectivity, wifi, a
residential blackout or the system needing a reboot/restart. These all
should have been anticipated. Surely the possibility of system failure
or even a failure in internet connectivity should have been anticipated
in the design phase with worst case scenario plan available such as a
back up feeding schedule connected to the local unit in case of such
situations?

It's noteworthy that whilst PetNet has been able to [resolve their
server problem](https://twitter.com/petnetiosupport) in a reasonable
time frame, the stress of the situation on holidaying pet owners cannot
be underestimated. It really is a great opportunity for opponents of IoT
to post pictures of vulnerable kittens and puppies waiting at home,
alone for their dinner. A few twitter and facebook updates and an email
does not do much to reassure people. However it is commendable that the
company is contacting consumers directly to ensure their system is up
and working.

The biggest lesson for consumers, is there need to read the fine print
associated with any connected devices they purchase, especially where at
risk scenarios may result. There are some interesting limitations of
service that effectively ensure that PetNet is not held responsible for
any service failures:

The situation also raises the bigger issues about the viability of
automated pet feeders as devices in themselves.  Few accommodate
multi-pet families where different diets for different breeds or species
are required, making the product impractical for many pet owners. Then
there's the real life realities of pet ownership. Food is a useful
training tool for pet owners, especially for cats that typically employ
disdain to any training attempts. Animals need regular human contact,
affection and play and in the case of dogs, regular exercise. Are we
going a step too far placing the nutritional needs of our animals at the
mercy of the failure of connected devices?
