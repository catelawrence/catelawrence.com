In a time where the driverless automated car is becoming a modern
reality, we are provided with great potential to make things previously
improbable if not impossible suddenly possible.

My interest was piqued when I came across design plans for car that
could be controlled by a driver with quadriplegia. At first the idea
seemed mere fantasy but as I spoke to transport designer Rajshekhar Dass
and learnt move about the control of technical devices through brain
waves, facial gestures and infinitesimal movements the idea seemed more
of conceivable.

Rajshekar Dass is a car designer from Mumbai, India currently based in
Turkey. He has an impressive design history which includes fronting a
winner team of the 2016 [Michelin Challenge
Design](https://www.michelinchallengedesign.com/the-challenge-archives/2016-mobility-for-all/2016-showcase-of-selected-entrants/) for
the [Google Community
Vehicle](https://www.behance.net/gallery/30421703/Google-Community-Vehicle-Michelin-Challenge-Design) and  Winner
of the  Vehicle, Mobility and Transport Design 2014-15 A'Design Award
for a [Micro
Taxi](https://competition.adesignaward.com/design.php?ID=39442) among
awards. He's interned for Volkswagen in Germany and worked in a range of
car dealerships, so has seen car technology from a range of angles.

He detailed his rationale for a car designed specifically for people
with quadraplegia, a cohort of people who until now have only featured
in the automated cars of the future as mere passengers. Such a design is
the first of its kind:

> "[Audric Design](https://www.behance.net/rajshekhardass) basically was
> designed with a particular person in mind, [Sam
> Schmidt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Schmidt), former Indy
> Racing League driver. He was made paraplegic due to a racing car
> accident in 2000.  He wanted to get back on the track but came back as
> an owner rather than driver. Everyone loves driving so my interest was
> how can we use today’s technology to solve these problems for an
> audience that are generally overlooked? How can today’s tech be used
> to enable the same driving experience that he enjoyed previously?"

It's always interesting to learn how a designer approaches the design
experience, Dass revealed:

> "the first point of research is the capabilities of the human body
> when functionality has been impaired. In paraplegia the brain signals
> do not reach the human organs  bellow the neck, so the brain signals
> are basically lost. I thought, what if you could use today's
> technology to enable the signals to be transferred to the computers
> onboard of a car instead, so you can give a rebirth to the whole
> driving experience?"

Dass explained that emerging technology like movement through brain wave
signals,  gesture and facial recognition and sensor technology s along
with  augmented reality made his design more than a well intentioned
concept.

There's precedence here. For example, in
2010 [ Emotiv](https://emotiv.com/) released the [Emotiv
Epoch+](https://emotiv.com/epoc/), a commercial wearable device designed
to enable users to play computer games on a screen through functioning
as a brain-computer interface device (Admittedly the design was not
without it's challenges as [this
review ](https://www.engadget.com/2010/01/27/review-emotiv-epoc-tough-thoughts-on-the-new-mind-reading-cont/)attests).

Then in 2014, Ian Burkhart became the first paralyzed person to use
neural bypass technology [to pick up and hold a
spoon](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/paralyzed-patient-regains-hand-movement-using-own-brain-signals/) using
his own brainpower, with his abilities increasing overtime.

How could it work?
------------------

Dass stresses that the car would be completely autonomous in the first
instance. But over time, the driver's gestures and motions would be
recorded by the car; for example, as the car is taking a right turn, the
driver might be tilting his head. In this way, the car is learning from
the driver instead of the driver learning from the car.

Dass explains further:

> <div>
>
> "There would be a series of levels which would be detected by the AI
> in the car, that slowly give the control to the driver. e.g. starting
> with audio and air-conditioning controls first. The next level could
> be controlling a little bit of the motion and *slowly* you’d graduate
> levels as you would in a game with the help of gesture recognition,
> eye movements and brain mapping. Once the car is confident as to the
> skill of the driver the complete controls would be available to the
> driver. but at the same time the car would still have the control over
> all the systems, as a built-in safety feature.

I'm aware that many people with paralysis experience involuntary
movement such as spasms and jerking. I wondered if a car could be smart
enough to distinguish these movements from voluntary actions.

Dass agreed:

> <div>

> </div>
>
> It's a good point. The car is completely autonomous and the AI is
> constantly monitoring the driver's motions to learn his/her actions,
> and since the AI is specially developed for paralyzed drivers it can
> recognize such involuntary movements. Since the AI is also scanning
> the brain and can understand that the motion has no connection with
> the brain signals it can be tagged as involuntary action and not
> require a reaction".

As well as its driving capabilities, the car would also be designed
specifically with the needs of the driver in mind with a rear entry door
suited to a wheelchair which would be specially designed to become the
driving seat in the vehicle. Dass explained that the project has only
been recently published online and he is keen to explore his ideas
further with people with disabilities and associated organizations to
enable further development.

In an era where ideas as seemingly bizarre as Google's patent
for“[sticky” technology to protect
pedestrians](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/18/google-patents-sticky-layer-self-driving-car-accidents) if
they get struck by Google's self-driving cars, a mind powered car
doesn't seem all that strange at all.

Dass is working on a range of diverse projects currently and judging by
the ingenuity inherent in his
design [portfolio](https://www.behance.net/rajshekhardass), this is
simply an example of things to come.
