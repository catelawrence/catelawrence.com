The 2016 Olympic Games in Rio bring not only teams of highly trained
athletes but also bags full of wearable technology which aims to monitor
the health and physicality of athletics as they prepare for peak
performance.

In these latest Games, we see sports psychology usurped by neuroscience
that is designed to maximize the power of the mind. One company working
hard in this space is [Halo Neuroscience](https://www.haloneuro.com/).

I've had the pleasure to interview the CEO
[previously](https://readwrite.com/2016/04/27/halo-neuro-change-brain-efficiency-vw1/) after
their pre-sales sold out within their first week of availability. So I
was keen to speak to Olympic athletes and coaches that are using Halo
Sport in preparation for the 2016 Olympics.

Meet the Halo Sport
-------------------

Halo Neuroscience has created a a headset called Halo Sport. It
resembles a pair of headphones and uses what it
call [neuro-priming](https://www.haloneuro.com/) – another term for
[transcranial direct current
stimulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcranial_direct-current_stimulation).
This involves the use of electrical pulses to encourage the brain to
form new pathways to increase performance. When paired with rigorous
athletic training, athletes see improved strength, explosiveness, and
skill. The United States Olympic Ski and Snowboard Association saw a
1.7X increase in performance when training with Halo Sport.

The athletes using the device in preparation for the Rio Olympics
include [Michael
Tinsley](https://www.teamusa.org/usa-track-and-field/athletes/Michael-Tinsley),
a 400m hurdler who won silver at the 2012 Olympics in London; [Mike
Rodgers](https://www.teamusa.org/usa-track-and-field/athletes/Mike-Rodgers),
who runs 100m sprints and will compete for gold on the relay
team; [Mikel
Thomas](https://www.iaaf.org/athletes/trinidad-and-tobago/mikel-thomas-237307),
a hurdler from Trinidad & Tobago who is competing in his third Olympics;
[Hafsatu
Kamara](https://www.iaaf.org/athletes/sierra-leone/hafsatu-kamara-281637),
a female sprinter from Sierra Leone who is competing in her first
Olympics and [Samantha
Achterberg](https://www.teamusa.org/usa-modern-pentathlon/athletes/Samantha-Achterberg),
a modern pentathlete from the United States who won gold at the 2012
U.S. Nationals.

Rodgers discussed his experience using this tech:

> “As an Olympian, I spend countless hours working out—both in the gym
> and on the track. Before Halo, I hadn’t seen a comprehensive solution
> to prepare the brain these for high-performance athletic activities.
> With Halo, I’m excited to get closer to my potential and reach an even
> higher level of athletic excellence.” – Mike Rodgers, USA, 400m sprint

Kamara claims a definite increase in strength:

> “I’ve been an athlete long enough to know when I have more strength
> and power, and I can definitely say that Halo Sport has helped me
> improve in those areas. During resistance training for example, I
> usually do weighted hip thrusts at 100 kg — after using Halo, I can
> now train at 120 kg and I feel like my training is pushing me in top
> form.” – Hafsatu Kamara, Sierra Leone, 100 & 200m sprint

I was wondering about what their coaches' perspectives would be. Darryl
Woodson, USA Track & Field Coach noted:

> “Before I was introduced to Halo Sport, I was always fascinated about
> how to improve the brain’s role in athletic performance. Every athlete
> knows the importance of training the mind, whether through
> visualization, watching film, or maintaining focus, but I was
> interested in how to improve the communication between the brain and
> muscles. Now that I’ve used Halo Sport with my athletes, I’m amazed
> that the brain has such a huge impact on performance. Integrating Halo
> Neurotechnology into my workouts transforms our training.”

It's clear that wearables are a key tool in maximizing physical
potential in physical endeavors. It's foreseeable that in the future
wearables will be permitted as acceptable sportswear whilst competing.
How this is managed and policed with be complicated, particularly in
individual sports.

But for these games, Halo Sport is not the only wearable inhabiting this
space, whoever partners with a medal winner has the potential to bring
their wearable device to the masses.
