It's been another wild year in swimming at the 2016 Rio Olympics. The
last events wrap up today, but it's been hard to miss the appearance of
more technology poolside this year, even if all you noticed were the
headphones helping Michael Phelps maintain his death-stare:

 

But getting into the zone while on deck isn't that new. Getting closer
to a world record is the greater goal of all this new technology. Here's
what you might have seen in swimmer's bags this year:

The Misfit Shine
----------------

![misfitshine](rw-import/misfitshine.jpg){.size-full
.wp-image-5641 .aligncenter width="635" height="448"}

In June, wearables company [Misfit](https://misfit.com/) and well know
sports swimming brand[Speedo](https://www.speedo.com/) announced the
launch of their second Speedo-branded activity, swim, and sleep tracker,
[Misfit Shine 2 Swimmers
Edition](https://misfit.com/products/shine2-swimmer-edition). Misfit and
Speedo’s proprietary lap counting algorithms track a swimmer’s lap count
with industry-leading accuracy and work for all stroke types.

New features with Speedo Shine include:

-    A vibration motor and multicolor lights, enabling multi-faceted
    user feedback—see progress and tell time in a halo of
    rainbow-colored lights, or get motivated with Misfit Move activity
-   A countdown swim timer—users pick a time to swim and Speedo Shine 2
    provides a gentle vibe alert when a workout is complete
-   Text and call notifications and a silent vibe alarm
-   Misfit Link compatibility, turning Speedo Shine 2 into a music
    remote, selfie trigger, presentation clicker, or button to enable a
    variety of smart home devices and web services

VTT wearable sensors
--------------------

![vtt\_uimari](rw-import/vtt_uimari-1024x575.jpg){.size-large
.wp-image-5642 .aligncenter width="1024" height="575"}

In cooperation with Finland's national  swimming team and archery
association, [VTT Technical Research
Centre](https://www.vtt.fi/medialle/uutiset/suomalaisurheilijat-hakevat-%C3%A4lyteknologiasta-vauhtia-olympialaisiin-%E2%80%93-usa-n-olympiakomitea-etsii-kumppaneita-suomesta)
of Finland has developed wearable technology for improving sports
performance. Wearable sensors can be attached to, say, a swimmer's hand
paddles or an archer's equipment. From there, data is wirelessly
transferred to the coach's smartphone or tablet**.  **

The sensors embedded in the paddles provide surprisingly precise and
varied data on the wearer's swimming technique. This covers stroke
length and changes in it during swimming, the relationship between the
outward stroke and recovery, the structure of the stroke and the average
pull, the hand position and the pressure exerted by the stroke in
different directions. According to Simo Karvinen, the Finnish Junior
Olympic Team coach:

> "Swimming is an unusual sport because it is not easy for the athlete
> to check his or her own performance in the water. In addition, very
> few means are available of measuring development in the swimmer's
> technique, in terms such as the efficiency of hand strokes. VTT's
> technology provides a means of directly observing the power of each
> hand stroke and its trajectory through the water, without disrupting
> performance."

Using sound data to boost performance
-------------------------------------

Researchers at Bielefeld University have developed a system that
professional swimmers can use to optimize their swimming technique. It
enables swimmers to hear, in real time, how the pressure of the water
flows created by the swimmer changes with their movements. This gives
the swimmer an advantage over their competitors because they can refine
the execution of their technique. This [“Swimming
Sonification”](https://www.cit-ec.de/en/content/news/boosting-swimming-performance-sound-data)
system was developed at the Cluster of Excellence Cognitive Interaction
Technology (CITEC) of Bielefeld University.

Dr. Thomas Hermann of CITEC is working on converting data into sounds
that can be used to benefit the listener. This is called sonification, a
process in which measured data values are systematically turned into
audible sounds and noises. “In this project, we are using the pressure
from water flows as the data source,” says Hermann. “We convert into
sound how the pressure of water flows changes while swimming – in real
time. We play the sounds to the swimmer over headphones so that they can
then adjust their movements based on what they hear,” explains Hermann.

This system includes two gloves worn during practice, featuring thin
tube ends that serve as pressure sensors and are fixed between the
fingers. The tubes are linked to a measuring device that transmits data
about water flow pressure to a laptop. Custom-made software then
sonifies the data; it turns the information into sound. The sounds are
transmitted to the swimmer in real time over headphones. When the
swimmer modifies a movement, he hears live how this also changes the
sound.

In a practical workshop held in September 2015, professional swimmers
tested the system out and confirmed that it indeed helped them to
optimize their swimming technique. Of the ten swimmers who participated,
three of them qualified for international competitions, and one of the
female swimmers is competing this year at the Paralympics in Rio de
Janeiro, Brazil.

The researchers want to continue developing their current prototype. “We
are planning to develop a wearable system that can be used independently
by the user, without the help of others,” says Thomas Hermann. In
addition to this, the new sonification method is planned to be
incorporated into long-term training programs in cooperation with swim
clubs.

Samsung blind cap
-----------------

![BlindCapSamsung3](rw-import/BlindCapSamsung3-1024x571.png){.size-large
.wp-image-5644 .aligncenter width="1024" height="571"}

Samsung's latest innovation is  a special swimming cap that vibrates to
alert the swimmers precisely when to do their flip turn at the end of
the pool. The [Blind Cap](https://www.blindcap.com/en/) eliminates the
need for a coach or guide to physically tap the swimmer with a pole to
indicate the lane coming to an end - - the method used since swimming
for the blind was established as an official Paralympic sport in 1960.

The Blind Cap is equipped with a vibrating sensor and Bluetooth
technology. It synchronizes with the Samsung Gear S2 smartwatch and any
Android smartphone to work in conjunction with an app. This allows the
swimmer's coach to send a warning signal from their smartphone or
smartwatch, which is converted into a vibration within the cap of the
blind swimmer, prompting the swimmer to turn without additional help.

What about swimming googles?
----------------------------

![1395377884375735334](rw-import/1395377884375735334.jpg){.size-full
.wp-image-5645 .aligncenter width="679" height="383"}

Evidence suggests that connected googles are indeed on the way but seem
to be taking longer in manufacturing than anticipated. [OnCourse
Googles](https://www.oncoursegoggles.com/) is created googles designed
for open water swimming (ok, so technically these are more for the World
Aquatic Games than the Olympics) to help keep the wearer swimming in a
straight line using a pair of subtle LEDs. The goggles analyze the
direction the user is swimming and if they veer off course. LEDs notify
them of which direction they need to swim in order to remain on course
as well as the severity of deviation.

These were predicted to be launched in the summer of 2016 but remain
absent. Lebanon-based startup [Instabeat](https://www.instabeat.me/) has
also created smart googles that specifically measure a swimmer's
heartbeat. However they've been subject to significant delays of over
two years and are pledging to go to retail in Q1 2017.

In a sport where the difference between winning and losing is a
hundredth of a second, there are no doubt boxes of technological
innovations that are kept under wraps by the Olympic teams.

We'll probably only become aware of these if medalists and their media
machine sponsors, decide to share the word.
