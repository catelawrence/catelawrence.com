The notion of smart dust sounds like a work of science fiction but
scientists at [University of California
Berkeley](https://news.berkeley.edu/2016/08/03/sprinkling-of-neural-dust-opens-door-to-electroceuticals/) have
developed a "neural dust" that can be implanted into the body,
to monitor internal nerves, muscles or organs in real time.

The sensors are about the size of a large grain of sand contain a
piezoelectric crystal that converts ultrasound vibrations from outside
the body into electricity to power a tiny, on-board transistor that is
in contact with a nerve or muscle fiber. A voltage spike in the fiber
alters the circuit and the vibration of the crystal, which changes the
echo detected by the ultrasound receiver, typically the same device that
generates the vibrations. The slight change, called backscatter, allows
them to determine the voltage.

The research could one day lead to brain machine interfaces for
controlling prosthetics and robotics as well as faciliate a new
biohealth industry of "electroceuticals."

Contemporary implantable electrodes degrade within 1 to 2 years, and all
connect to wires that pass through holes in the skull. Wireless sensors
could be sealed in stopping  unwanted movement of the electrodes and
prevention of infection.\

Is smart dust the pinnacle of IoT creativity?
---------------------------------------------

Research by [Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3114217) into
'hype cycles' within emerging technology predicts that Smart Dust will
become trend within 5 to 10 years. It's a field that has been developing
within research laboratories [since the late
1990's](https://robotics.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pister/SmartDust/), with
funding by the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency
[(DARPA)](https://www.darpa.mil/) to create applications of military
relevance, their work involving "evolutionary and revolutionary advances
in miniaturization, integration, and energy management."

[As early as
2003](https://www.computerworld.com/article/2581821/mobile-wireless/smart-dust.html),
researchers were working on applications for smart dust, which they
characterised "tiny wireless microelectromechanical sensors (MEMS) that
can detect everything from light to vibrations". Commercial applications
considered included serving as traffic sensors in congested urban areas
and monitoring the power consumption of household appliances to
determine whether they're operating at peak efficiency. However,
scientific advances have moved the smart dust motes from everyday sensor
technology applications to implanted wearable devices.

According to neuroscientist Jose Carmena:

> “The beauty is that now, the sensors are small enough to have a good
> application in the peripheral nervous system, for bladder control or
> appetite suppression, for example. The technology is not really there
> yet to get to the 50-micron target size, which we would need for the
> brain and central nervous system. Once it’s clinically proven,
> however, neural dust will just replace wire electrodes. This time,
> once you close up the brain, you’re done.“

The team at work to miniaturize the device further, find more
biocompatible materials and improve the surface transceiver that sends
and receives the ultrasounds, ideally using beam-steering technology to
focus the sounds waves on individual motes. They are now building little
backpacks for rats to hold the ultrasound transceiver that will record
data from implanted motes.

"Dust" could also detect chemical levels
----------------------------------------

They’re also working to expand the motes’ ability to detect
non-electrical signals, such as oxygen or hormone levels.

“The vision is to implant these neural dust motes anywhere in the body,
and have a patch over the implanted site send ultrasonic waves to wake
up and receive necessary information from the motes for the desired
therapy you want,” said Dongjin Seo, a graduate student in electrical
engineering and computer sciences. “Eventually you would use multiple
implants and one patch that would ping each implant individually, or all
simultaneously.”

The biggest barrier to the mainstreaming of smart dust is perhaps the
reality that at present, it requires surgical implanting. Will it be
possible in the future to swallow or inhale the dust? Our digestive
system makes it highly questionable, but it's an interesting idea. At
any rate, as the dust gets smaller, it's entry into the central nervous
system and brain could lead to life changing interventions for people
with particular health conditions and disabilities. It'll be a way off,
but if the research so far is anything to go by, it's inevitable.
