    get the short shrift in Olympic years. But a new event, the Cybathlon, may be
    the future.

With the [2016
Paralympics](https://www.rio2016.com/en/paralympics/sports) kicking off
in a couple of weeks, highly trained athletes are preparing for a range
of competitive events that pit people with similar disabilities against
each other in 528 events sports including wheelchair basketball, blind
rugby and canoe sprints.

But as sports training and equipment becomes more technologically
advanced, some are asking question about the place of technology in the
Paralympics.

After [VISTA 2013 themed that year on "Equipment and Technology in
Paralympic Sports](https://www.paralympic.org/vista-2013)", speaker,
participants and sports enthusiasts were asking about the parity of
equipment in the Paralympics given the cost of highly advanced
technology. Some questioned whether the more wealthy countries would
dominate the medal tables as they potentially have more money to develop
"performance enhancing" technology. Others questioned the role of
science and technology and whether it would surpass the raw ability of
the athlete.

Brendan Burkett, an ex-Paralympian swimmer and now professor in
biomechanics at the University of the Sunshine Coast commented:

This is further challenged by a lack of sponsorship for individual
competitors, [low ticket
sales](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/17/paralympic-ticket-sales-slow-as-fears-mount)
and limited television access compared to the Olympic games.

But one event is taking a different approach.

The inaugural [Cybathlon](https://www.cybathlon.ethz.ch/) kicks off on
October 8 in Zurich, Switzerand and will see 74 athletes from 25
countries competing to show how robotic technology helps them in their
daily lives. Competitors are referred to as "pilots" and depending on
their disability, they compete in a series of tasks to test their
agility, dexterity and speed.

Obstacle courses with prosthetics and wheelchairs
-------------------------------------------------

In the respective obstacle courses, four pilots compete simultaneously
on parallel tracks against each other to solve six tasks in the shortest
time. For example, in the obstacle course with prosthetic legs,
different step sequences and movements must be carried out such as
climbing stars and walking across a beam. Those with prosthetic arms
must demonstrate dexterity with a range of fine motor skills tasks.

In the motorized wheelchair course, wheelchairs which are controlled by
joystick, tongue control, touchpad or by other technologies are approved
and their pilots are encouraged in small teams to develop innovative
solutions to everyday access challenges such as [building inputs with
thresholds, uneven pavements or steep ramps. Eligible athletics include
those with ]{.goog-text-highlight}various types of spinal cord injuries,
bilateral leg amputations or other serious injuries that make walking
impossible.

Exoskeleton obstacle course

For Cybathlon, the most comfortable and most agile exoskeletons are
sought which enable pilots to perform various everyday movements easily
and reliably - even climbing stairs or walking on uneven terrain. Only
pilots with complete leg paralysis due to a spinal cord injury can
participate competing on simultaneous parallel tracks.

Virtual Racing with Brain Control Interface (BCI)
-------------------------------------------------

Brain-computer interfaces are able to detect brain signals enabling
people with various levels of paralysis to move things with their mind.
In virtual racing the pilot utilizes thought control to control
characters - - or avatars - - in a specially developed computer game.
The pilots must send the appropriate signals at the right moment so that
their avatars jump over obstacles or accelerate. False signals lead to a
slow down or a clash. Most teams use the electroencephalography (EEG)
for detecting brain signals, but other methods such as near-infrared
spectroscopy (NIRS) are permitted.

The Cybathlon is designed to provide a platform for the development of
novel, practical assistive technologies whilst breaking down barriers
between people with disabilities, the public and technology developers.
It's not turning people into cyborgs but it is an opportunity to
participate in an event with the world's most ground breaking access
technology.

It'll be interesting to see it's impact on the Paralympics and whether
it attracts people audiences and sponsors to the innovative world of
adaptive technology.
