According to the [Women's Heart
Foundation](https://www.womensheart.org/content/HeartDisease/gender_differences.asp), coronary
artery disease is the leading cause of death in women. More than twice
as many women die from cardiovascular disease as from all forms of
cancer combined. Evaluation for suspected coronary disease differs in
women because of frequently misleading results provided by treadmill
testing without imaging. Gender differences have been observed in
treatment practices, and the optimal approach for women has yet to be
established.

[Wanda Health](https://yourwanda.com/) is a predictive analytics firm
that focuses on the treatment and prevention of chronic disease such a
heart disease, by developing

and hydration. myWanda then delivers daily tips, advice, and inspiration
to help women stay on track to achieve these goals, thereby creating
measurable improvements to their heart health and overall well-being.

myWanda simplifies patients' lives
----------------------------------

Although heart disease is the number one killer of women in America,
approximately 80 percent of cases are preventable through education and
lifestyle changes. This is where myWanda comes in – leveraging data
science, applied medical research, and proven engagement methodologies
to deliver support through an engaging, visually-driven mobile
interface.

Wanda is dedicated to simplifying and improving the lives of individuals
with chronic conditions, blending predictive analytics and behavioral
science to enrich the remote health and patient management
experience.[myWanda is the company’s first consumer
app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mywanda/id1125216315?ls=1&mt=8),
featuring a leading-class personalized communication strategy that makes
it easy for women to receive support, education, and guidance. Wanda’s
digital health platform collects critical information from individuals
and utilizes machine learning to deliver ongoing risk analysis and
decision support.

“We’re excited to bring a technology solution to market that can truly
inform, motivate, and support women to take better care of their hearts
— and potentially save lives in the process,” said Wanda CEO Steve Curd.

“At Wanda, our approach has always been crystal-clear: how do we
translate the most advanced technological capabilities into
human-centered solutions,” according to CCO Mark Heinemeyer. “The
myWanda app truly embodies the vision of harnessing powerful
technologies to improve people’s lives.”  Heinemeyer further notes that
Wanda intends to sync myWanda with multiple wearable devices in the
future and that myWanda will soon accept data from many of the popular
personal fitness wearable devices.
