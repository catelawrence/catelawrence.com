In recent years IoT has played an important role in worker safety with
wearable and embedded sensors making it possible for workers to be
monitored within their surroundings to prevent injury
from[falls](https://www.fujitsu.com/global/about/resources/news/press-releases/2015/0511-01.html),
[toxic
gas](https://www.honeywell.com/newsroom/pressreleases/2015/11/honeywell-and-intel-demonstrate-prototype-of-wearable-iot-connected-safety-solutions-for-industrial-workers-and-first-responders),
and [overexertion](https://www.smartcaptech.com/). Wearable technology
can prevent a range of injuries in some of the most dangerous
occupations.

[North Star Bluescope
Steel](https://www.northstarbluescope.com/default.asp), a steel producer
for global building and construction industries for Australia, New
Zealand and North American markets, is [working with
IBM](https://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/49994.wss) to
develop a cognitive platform that taps into IBM Watson IoT technology
for wearable safety technology to help employees stay safer in dangerous
environments. By gathering and analyzing sensor data collected from
sensors embedded in helmets and wrist bands, the technology, IBM
Employee Wellness and Safety Solution, provides real-time alerts to
employees and their managers, enabling preventive measures if physical
well-being is compromised or safety procedures are not being followed.

The solution can detect hazardous combinations that individually may be
overlooked. For example, a combination of skin temperature, raised heart
rate, and no movement patterns for several minutes could mean a person
is suffering from heat stress. Each of these signs individually would
not be a cause for alert, but together they indicate a serious situation
that warrants intervention.

The majorities of workplace injuries are easily preventable through
personal monitoring. Injuries can be prevented, whether by ensuring that
protective equipment is used correctly, or that time or location
limitations for hazardous situations are monitored. Integrating and
presenting contextual information to field workers from a wide variety
of sensors creates more aware and well informed workers. It’s a method
that is non-intrusive, hands-free, always-on, environment-aware, and
offers the direct delivery of critical information to those who need it,
when they need it.

Through the use of the IBM Employee Wellness and Safety Solution, we
have observed an increased awareness of heat stress and exertion in our
trial users, said Malcolm Edge, I.T. Director, NorthStar Bluescope
Steel, adding:

> “The solution has provided a proof of concept showcasing how data can
> flow from the user to the IBM Watson IoT Platform and back to a
> supervisor for intervention. This solution, once fully developed, will
> provide a solid foundation for increasing worker safety by providing
> real time monitoring of the environment around the worker.”

Steelworking and heat stress go together
----------------------------------------

In an effort to combat heat stress, Northstar is using the IBM Employee
Wellness and Safety Solution to collect data from various sensors that
continuously monitor the worker’s skin body temperature, heart rate,
galvanic skin response and level of activity, correlated with sensor
data for ambient temperature and humidity. The solution then enables
Northstar to provide personalized safety guidelines to each individual
employee, advising them to take a ten minute break in the shade, if
temperatures rise to unsafe levels.

The same platform can be used to prevent excessive exposure to different
temperatures, radiation levels, noise, or toxic gases, using sensor tags
for temperature, humidity, noise, or light measurements. Gases can be
detected using personal sensors enabled using Wifi or Bluetooth low
energy sensors.

Connected workers are not only inherently safer, and personal monitoring
can also lead to more productive workers. Monitoring workers can help
implement measures that lead to less fatigue, less time spent on
unnecessary tasks, and more time focused on the most critical tasks.
