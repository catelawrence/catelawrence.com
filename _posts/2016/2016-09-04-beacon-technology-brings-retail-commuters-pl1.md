[The Shop and Ride beacon and app system, powered by
[[Xerox](https://www.xerox.com/), is promising to]{.s2} deliver
personalized, hyperlocal, mobile offers to transit riders based on their
preferences and travel patterns. ]{.s1}

[Beacon technology placed in local bus shelters and at merchant sites
communicates with the app so users are notified of existing offers in
the area or at a particular store. With a single touch, riders can save
a coupon to redeem it immediately or at a later time.]{.s1}

*[**See also:** [Freckle beacons want you to get your ESPN
on](https://readwrite.com/2016/07/15/freckle-partners-airkast-dt4/)]{.s1}*

[Merchants also benefit from the app. They share two mobile offers per
week with Shop and Ride app users. Xerox provides the merchants with
real-time tracking of deal conversions and anonymized data – such as the
number of users who save, open and redeem the coupons. This allows
merchants to make data-driven decisions based on which offers resonate
most with consumers.]{.s1}

[The app grew out of research conducted at Xerox's storied R&D
facility [[PARC]{.s2}](https://www.parc.com/), working in concert with
other Xerox
[[innovation]{.s2}](https://www.xerox.com/en-us/innovation) efforts
helping transportation customers integrate mobile technology into their
offerings. Shop and Ride joins other Xerox urban mobility projects being
deployed around the world. ]{.s1}

[Earlier this year, Xerox launched [[Go
LA]{.s2}](https://www.news.xerox.com/news/City-of-LA-introduces-new-Xerox-Go-LA-app),
[[Go
Denver]{.s2}](https://www.news.xerox.com/news/City-of-Denver-introduces-new-Xerox-Go-Denver-app)
and recently Go Bangalore to encourage multimodal transportation. These
apps capture all available transportation options in the city and
compute the shortest, cheapest and most sustainable ways to reach a
commuter’s destination. ]{.s1}

[Belying their office product and photocopying history, Xerox is also a
leading provider of [[transportation technology
services]{.s2}](https://services.xerox.com/transportation-solutions/enus.html) worldwide,
including tolling, parking, mass transit and photo enforcement services,
supporting governments in more than 30 countries.]{.s1}

Beacons are becoming routine for retail
---------------------------------------

[German lottery operator Westdeutsche Lotterie (WestLotto) is piloting a
Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacon solution to attract consumers into 60
outlets at which they can buy lottery tickets. The system, provided by
Berlin-based technology company Sensorberg, delivers coupons and other
location-based content to WestLotto app users, and then tracks whether
those individuals enter stores and make purchases based on those
offers.]{.s1}

As well, [South Korea's
YAP](https://readwrite.com/2016/06/29/yap-looks-take-onpayment-beacons-pt1/)
is looking westward to expand after conquering Vietnam and China, with a
beacon network aimed at storefront retailers.
