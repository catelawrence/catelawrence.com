The world of agricultural technology, or agtech, is rapidly evolving.

It's [automating laborious
tasks](https://readwrite.com/2016/04/04/iot-makes-smart-wine-agriculture-if4/)
and[providing farmers and growers with greater knowledge and
insight](https://readwrite.com/2016/06/07/can-arables-iot-device-end-world-hunger-vl1/)
into their crops than ever before. As technology evolves so does the
needs of the farmer and the growing environment. Around 20% of the
world's food production is grown within cities rather rural areas and
inherent in this is the[multi-billion dollar industry of indoor growing
and
hydroponics](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/growth-in-the-hydroponics-food-industry-set-to-outpace-global-markets-by-80-241264701.html).

The industry includes \$5 billion in urban farming in the US and \$5.7
billion for legal cannabis production.

Agtech company [motorleaf](https://www.motorleaf.com/) have released the
world's first wireless monitoring, motion detection and automated
growing system for hobby and industrial growers. I spoke to CEO and
co-founder Ally Monk to learn more.

According to Monk, the idea originated when as a keen indoor hobby
gardener, motorleaf's co-founder and CTO Ramen Dutta wanted to go on
holidays and needed a system to take care of his plants in his absence:

> happen to his plants in his absence. He looked at the market and
> assumed there would be something like a smart home system akin to
> google Nest but there was nothing.  So he started making a HUB that
> could monitor what was going on and automate a range of appliances
> such as the water chiller and water level, air temperature, webcam,
> heating, and cooling. He soon realized that other indoor farmers were
> interested.

How motorleaf works
-------------------

Motorleaf has created a system that can automate and monitor an indoor
growth area with up to 5 acre coverage. Their hardware, described by
some as ["Nest meets Lego for
agriculture](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/motorleaf#/entity)"
is designed to be plug-and-play, and the grower decides which part of
their plant operation they control/monitor and automate. It consists of
four modular units:

-   *The Heart* collects Air Temp, Humidity, & Light Level data. Users
    can connect any lighting hardware, and feeder pump - and start
    automating their operation in seconds.
-   *The Power Leaf* connects wirelessly to the Heart which tells them
    when to turn on and off, based upon pre-set times or sensor readings
    from the Heart and Droplet.
-    *The Droplet* monitors everything that’s connected to a grower's
    water reservoir. Every 4 seconds The Droplet wirelessly sends data
    to The Heart, information on water level, temperature, PH level, and
    nutrient levels.
-   *The Driplet *allows growers to automate the delivery of PH and
    Nutrients, again based upon timer setting or actual live grow
    conditions.

.wp-image-5015 .aligncenter width="750" height="461"}

The system is agnostic, retails for about \$1,500 and contains free
software which facilitates custom settings, so the motorleaf hardware
will automate the grower's equipment and adjust to their crop's needs.
It's available online and offline as many growers do not have WiFi in
their crop space.  It also alerts the grower to any problems that need
attending to.

More importantly, it also involves intuitive efforts in predicting and
anticipating the needs of the plants. Monk says:

<div>

> <div>
>
> "We’ve never been able to speak to plants but now through technology
> we can listen to them through their data, we can then understand what
> they need and feedback instructions to the equipment that's looking
> after them so we can best serve their crops.
>
> </div>

</div>

He also notes the many people's depiction of the farmer outdoor engaged
in manual labour as not entirely actually noting "The farmer of the
future looks after his farm through his mobile phone and tablet." He
adds that indoor growers in particular have needs which can be more
complex than traditional farming:

> <div>
>
> "When you start growing indoors you have to mimic nature, they have
> worry bout all the things they have to control indoors such as PH;
> nutrients, humidity, light, air temperature.  How are they controlling
> it? Switches, controllers, some software  and in many cases people are
> still using pen and paper. Urban farming is on the rise but the
> technology that looks after this is really lagging behind."

Motorleaf is well-timed to respond to an emerging market. They receive
receives 40,000 data points per customer per week and therefore can
start predicting a crop’s needs, solving potential problems before they
exist. Also, the start-up plans to use its network of data and growers
to connect users to each other – on an opt-in basis – to share data,
plant recipes and knowledge.

With the growth in indoor agriculture, hobby farmers and small to medium
enterprises will soon benefit from effective IoT technology that enables
smart crops and smart farming.
