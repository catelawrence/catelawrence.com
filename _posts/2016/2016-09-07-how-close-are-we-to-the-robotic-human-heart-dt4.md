We live in a society where human health is increasingly enhanced by
artificial augmentation and implantation including hip replacements and
hearing aids. French company [Carmat](https://www.carmatsa.com/en/) have
been working for 15 years on the artificial heart, a device that
completely replaces the human heart in people with end stage heart
disease and a life expectancy of less than two weeks without the
surgery.

They've recently announced their [second
trial,](///Users/catelawrence/Downloads/CP_CARMAT_demarrage-PIVOT_vf.pdf)
commencing in 2017 with the aim to achieve European approval for their
device.  The Carmat device differs to other robotic heart devices as it
is meant to be used in cases of terminal heart failure, instead of being
used as a bridge device while the patient awaits a transplant.

How it works
------------

![phoca\_thumb\_l\_03](rw-import/phoca_thumb_l_03.jpg){.size-large
.wp-image-6727 .aligncenter width="640" height="480"}

In Carmat's design, two chambers are each divided by a membrane that
holds hydraulic fluid on one side. A motorized pump moves hydraulic
fluid in and out of the chambers, and that fluid causes the membrane to
move; blood flows through the other side of each membrane. The
blood-facing side of the membrane is made of tissue obtained from a sac
that surrounds a cow's heart, to make the device more biocompatible.

The Carmat device also uses valves made from cow heart tissue and has
sensors to detect increased pressure within the device. That information
is sent to an internal control system that can adjust the flow rate in
response to increased demand, such as when a patient is exercising.

The heart is connected to external systems; a power supply, monitoring
and hospital control system for the post-operative period and subsequent
outpatient visits and a portable or wearable power supply and
communication system for the patient to return home.

A new heart is not an exact science
-----------------------------------

So far, the success of their artificial heart transplants has been
couched in research terms with success in the previous four person
feasibility trial defined as survival at 30 days. Their model has been
trialled on four people all of which have died.

Carmat's
[first](https://www.france24.com/en/20140303-first-patient-fitted-with-carmat-artificial-heart-dies)
transplant patient, died in March 2014, two-and-a-half months after his
operation apparently due to a device failure. The
[second ](https://www.qmed.com/news/fourth-patient-treated-carmat-artificial-heart-dies)[died
in May 2015, nine months after
]{.goog-text-highlight}[having]{.goog-text-highlight}[ been
grafted. These two deaths had been caused by "micro-leakage of the blood
area to the operating liquid of the prosthesis" having created a
"disturbance electronic engine control" of the artificial heart,
according to the
[analysis](https://www.lemonde.fr/analyses/ "All the analyzes news"){.lien_interne
.rub} of Carmat.]{.goog-text-highlight}

The
[third](///Users/catelawrence/Downloads/151222_pr_carmat_dec_2015_vf_eng_3.pdf)
died after nine months due to "respiratory arrest during chronic renal
failure” and the patient was suffering “from a combination of severe
diseases, especially kidney failure already diagnosed prior to
implantation of the prosthesis and warranting regular hospital visits.”
It was also stated that the heart continued to beat after the patient
had died and that “the medical team turned off the prosthetic device on
confirmation of the patient’s death.” The
[fourth](https://www.lemonde.fr/sante/article/2016/01/21/mort-du-quatrieme-patient-greffe-du-c-ur-artificiel-de-carmat_4850749_1651302.html)
and final patient died from medical complications associated with his
critical pre - and post-operative state

The company is now pushing on with a trial aimed at securing European
approval. It will enroll 25 patients and this time the endpoint will be
survival at three months. Says Marcello Conviti, CEO of Carmat:

> “Our target is to have all the data submitted by the end of 2017 and
> commercial availability in selected CE mark countries at the beginning
> of 2018,”

What is the future?
-------------------

Clearly we're a long way from the dreams of futurist tech predictors
that for see a future where one's heart beat could be regulated through
their smartphone.  Transhumanist Zoltan Istvan  sees a future where
"artificial hearts will be Wi-Fi-enabled and could be sped up with a
smartphone to have wild sex when you want it and sped down to sleep
better at night." according to the *[International Business
Times](https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/brain-implants-robotic-hearts-transhumanist-zoltan-istvans-technology-predictions-2025-1533209). * He
goes on to concede that there's a potential risk that an artificial
heart could be hacked.

There is however no demonstrable evidence that an artificial heart (or
[pacemaker](https://www.wired.com/2016/03/go-ahead-hackers-break-heart/)for
the matter) could be hacked. But the *fear* of course, is real. For
example  in 2014,  former Vice President Dick Cheney revealed that his
doctor ordered the wireless functionality of his heart implant disabled
due to[fears it might be hacked in an assassination
attempt](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2013/10/21/yes-terrorists-could-have-hacked-dick-cheneys-heart/).
Other research reveals that medical devices such as insulin pumps
are[vulnerable to security
breaches](https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/AlertsandNotices/ucm446809.htm),
which places connected biomechanic and robotic devices in a uneasy space
considering their functional capabilities are to assist the health of
the seriously ill.
