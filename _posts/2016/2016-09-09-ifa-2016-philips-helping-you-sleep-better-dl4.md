With more patients seeking medical care for sleep disorders, the world
is waking up to the challenge of healthy sleep, its impact on overall
health and the need for a good’s night rest.

During the recent [IFA](https://www.ifa-berlin.de/) conference here in
Berlin, Philips presented the Dream Family solution designed to improve
the sleep therapy experience for people with [obstructive sleep
apnea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_sleep_apnea) (OSA).
More than 100 million people worldwide are estimated to have OSA, a
serious condition that is treated with positive airway pressure (PAP)
therapy. [The Dream
Family](https://www.usa.philips.com/healthcare/solutions/sleep-and-respiratory-care/dream-family),
comprised of the DreamWear mask, DreamStation PAP device, and
DreamMapper patient engagement app, is designed to engage sleep apnea
patients with one of the most comfortable and effective therapies
available.

The components of the Dream Family were inspired by feedback from more
than 900 patients as well as insights from clinicians who treat sleep
apnea. This input combined with Philips’ more than four decades of
experience developing revolutionary patient-centric solutions led to the
award-winning design of the Dream Family. Since their launch in October
2015, DreamWear and DreamStation have been honored for excellence in
design, including recent iF Design, Red Dot, Good Design Australia, and
Core77 accolades.

> “Sleep therapy can be challenging, and our goal is to help people
> across the globe get a better night’s rest – whether they live with a
> chronic sleep condition or are struggling to achieve eight hours a
> night,” said John Frank, CEO of the Sleep and Respiratory Care unit at
> Philips.
>
> “Next to nutrition and exercise, sleep is the third pillar of health
> and now we are looking to the future for all people who need help with
> improving their sleep quality. We intend to make good sleep possible

It's interesting that they've stuck to the design of a mask for treating
sleep apnea. This year, Startup
[Airing](https://www.fundairing.com/#first-ever-micro-cpap) raised more
than \$1.5 million
on[Indiegogo](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/airing-the-first-hoseless-maskless-micro-cpap-sleep-technology#/)
for its creation of a far cheaper, mask-less, cordless, continuous
positive airway pressure (CPAP) device to treat obstructive sleep apnea,
an alternative to masks which many users find uncomfortable to wear at
night, to the extent that 50% of CPAP users stop using it within one
year. However, they have yet to get FDA clearance, a process that can
take some time.

Light therapy goes mainstream
-----------------------------

Philips also showcased two light therapy solutions designed to improve
the experience of getting out of bed.

Philips' [EnergyUp Energy
Lights](https://www.philips-store.com/store/catalog/light-therapy/energy-light/golite-blu-energy-light/productdetail/HF3429_60_US_SHOPPUB/US/en "Opens in a new window") lights
help combat energy dips caused by jet lag, long hours inside an office,
or general fatigue. A white light mimics the natural energizing power of
daylight, and is clinically proven to increase energy levels and
mood[.]{style="font-size: 13.3333px;line-height: 20px"}  There's also a
blue light for people to use when traveling or at the office.

There's also [Wake-up
Light](https://www.philips-store.com/store/catalog/light-therapy/wake-up-light/wake-up-light/productdetail/HF3520_60_US_SHOPPUB/US/en "Opens in a new window"), clinically
proven to provide a more energetic wake-up in the morning and reduces
sleepiness after waking up. The technology allows users to simulate the
sunrise and choose the preferred sound for their wake up. They aren't
cheap, retailing from \$159 but do also function as a radio and alarm
clock.

It's good to see Philips creating products that have the benefit to
improve the lives of many sleepless people, who would probably pay
anything for a good night's sleep and greater energy levels.
