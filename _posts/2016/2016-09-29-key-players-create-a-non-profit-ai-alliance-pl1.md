Tech giants Microsoft, IBM, Amazon, Google’s DeepMind, Facebook have
joined forces to create a non-profit alliance called [Partnership on
Artificial Intelligence to Benefit People and
Society](https://Partnership%20on%20Artificial%20Intelligence%20to%20Benefit%20People%20and%20Society) that
will work to advance public understanding of artificial intelligence
technologies (AI) and formulate best practices on the challenges and
opportunities within the field.

Academics, non-profits, and specialists in policy and ethics will be
invited to join the Board of the organization.

The objective of the partnership is to address opportunities and
challenges with AI technologies to benefit people and society. Together,
the organization’s members will conduct research, recommend best
practices, and publish research under an open license in

areas such as ethics, fairness, and inclusivity; transparency, privacy,
and interoperability; collaboration between people and AI systems; and
the trustworthiness, reliability, and robustness of the technology.

The organization’s founding members will each contribute financial and
research resources to the partnership and will share leadership with
independent third-parties, including academics, user group advocates,
and industry domain experts. There will be equal representation of
corporate and non-corporate members on the board of this new
organization.

Eric Horvitz, Technical Fellow & Managing Director, Microsoft Research
said:

> “We’re excited about this historic collaboration on AI and its
> influences on people and society. We see great value ahead with
> harnessing AI advances in numerous areas, including health, education,
> transportation, public welfare, and personal empowerment. We’re
> extremely pleased with how early discussions among colleagues
> blossomed into a promising long-term collaboration. Beyond folks in
> industry, we’re thrilled to have other stakeholders at the table,
> including colleagues in ethics, law, policy, and the public at large.
> We look forward to working arm-in-arm on best practices and on such
> important topics as ethics, privacy, transparency, bias,
> inclusiveness, and safety.”

Who's in...and who's out

not intend to lobby government or other policymaking bodies, yet members
will presumably include legal professionals. After all, it's likely that
there will be significant challenges to the rule of law, at least in the
developed world, as AI advances into all echelons of society and policy
in a broad range of areas from health care to military analytics. The
law in general has traditionally struggled to maintain pace with the
rapid advancements of technological innovation.

Notably absent are Apple and [Open AI](https://openai.com/about/), the
non-profit research think tank created by Elon Musk in 2015, though it's
possible they will be late additions. It's foreseeable that as AI
develops as the next industrial revolution, preceded by IoT, that a
number of watchdog organizations will develop to respond to the
challenges of AI particularly in regard to changes to the workforce in
some sectors and the social challenges like robotic ethics. The next few
years will be a time of fascinating research and discussions for all.
