In the increasingly crowded market place of smart watches, a small niche
of companies is offering an alternative to the standard designs by
offering smart watch bands as an alternative to smartwatch faces.

One of these is Madrid - and Paris-based
startup [Maintool](https://maintool.me/), who have created the Classi
watch band, a wearable which enables users to make their regular watches
“smart."

I met with co-founder and CEO Hussain Ahamed and Community Manager Jody
Serrano to learn more.

"We're giving you the chance to keep your own watch but still benefit
from the same functionalities as some of the best wearable
technologies," Ahamed said.

The smart watch band can be attached to any watch face. It offers a
range of functionalities: sensors within the watch band measure heart
rate, track footsteps and calories burned (pedometer), skin and ambient
temperatures, alert through discrete vibrations and communicate with
apps for iOS and Android. You can navigate to your destination
hands-free and send out for help with the push of a button. Classi also
has a phone loss prevention feature and will vibrate strongly if you
forget your phone.

Serrano notes that "Many times, people can't tell the difference between
a Classi strap and a regular watch strap. We switched out the microUSB
port we used in our first prototypes for a custom magnetic charger,
which greatly reduced the thickness of our watch straps. The new size
makes our technology even more discreet."

Enter the smart watchband
-------------------------

Sales of Swiss watches are on the incline with global wearable tech
devices overtaking them in Q4 of 2015, according to[figures
released](https://www.strategyanalytics.com/strategy-analytics/news/strategy-analytics-press-releases/strategy-analytics-press-release/2016/02/18/global-smartwatch-shipments-overtake-swiss-watch-shipments-in-q4-2015#.V9ksVJN95E4)
by market researcher Strategy Analytics.

This marked the first time the wearable tech devices have overtaken
their luxurious counterparts. Much of the credit is attributed to the
Apple smartwatch. Further, a [2015
report](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/ch/Documents/consumer-business/ch-en-consumer-business-deloitte-swiss-watch-study-2015.pdf)
by Deloitte into the Swiss watch industry revealed a lack of
appreciation of the challenges to the industry by smart watches with
only 25% of Swiss watch executives considered smartwatches to be a
competitive threat.

In response to the challenge of the economic outlook of the industry,
41% of respondents expressed pessimism with most attributing the
economic challenges to weakened demand in China and Hong Kong and the
strength of the Swiss franc. It suggests an industry that is in denial
with Neil Mawston, Executive Director at Strategy Analytics stating:

> “The Swiss watch industry has been very slow to react to the
> development of smartwatches. The Swiss watch industry has been
> sticking its head in the sand and hoping smartwatches will go away."

However, the upward trend of smart watches has begun to decline. IDC’s
second quarter [wearable sales
report](https://www.idc.com/tracker/showproductinfo.jsp?prod_id=962) for
2016 revealed a 27 percent decline in smart wearables and during this
time Apple had a significant decline in wearable sales. Sales dropped
from 3.6 million in the same quarter last year to 1.6 million this year,
a 56 percent downturn. Perhaps it's time for smart watchbands to strike.

Maintaining that Swiss watch heritage
-------------------------------------

Ahamed believes that their smart watchband can actually preserve the
heritage factor of the Swiss watch industry, noting that
their conversations with Swiss watch makers have been positive:

> " The CEOs and board members are acknowledging that they didn't get on
> board with quart \[Mechanical movements are typically chosen over
> quartz movements for luxury watches because of the level of quality
> and craftsmanship\]. They admit 'We’re Swiss so we’re going to be slow
> but we’re interested and we’re taking notice’. The beauty of Classi is
> that you’re not changing your industrial model. Instead you're
> allowing consumers to change to our strap."

He also contends that:

> "Every watch has a personality, we want people to be able to express
> themselves and their personal style. Smart watches don’t have a lot of
> personality, there’s so much more to the watch than something that
> just tells the time, for a lot of people it's about the design, the
> brand, the culture, Smart watches today destroy this. Classi has
> intergenerational appeal and we believe that for the first time, this
> is a product that our parents and grandparents will actually wear."

It'll be interesting to see how sales of smart watch bands fare. They
could be key to bridging the gap between a very traditional industry of
dedicated craftspeople and future focused technology.
