Last month, LinkedIn published a list of the most in-demand skills for the new year, with blockchain leading the top-ten list. In 2019, blockchain didn’t make the list at all. Blockchain also ranked as the most in-demand skills in the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Australia. It’s a skill sought in big enterprises like IBM, Oracle, and Deloitte, as well as plenty of startups (over 100 in Berlin alone).
