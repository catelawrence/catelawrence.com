Google “in-demand skills”, and you’ll see a plethora of lists of desirable knowledge and behaviours. These are typically a split between hard and soft skills. The underlying concept that separates the two is that hard skills involve intelligence and soft skills include emotions. But if you dig a bit deeper, you find this is not actually the case. Further, calling skills soft reduces their importance and power in furthering your career – I prefer the term essential skills.
