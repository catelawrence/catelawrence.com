IBM recently hosted&nbsp;Think Digital 2020, a series of fascinating talks, presentations, and interviews all facilitated remotely during the COVID-19 stay at home order. The two-day event was an opportunity to discuss the state of business and the role of critical technologies, such as&nbsp;AI&nbsp;for enterprise and&nbsp;Cloud, as clients accelerate recovery and digital transformation in the wake of COVID-19. Codemotion attended the event, and weâ€™re sharing some insights from some of the&nbsp;fantastic sessions.
