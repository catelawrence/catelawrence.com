You’d be hard-pressed to find a day where a cybersecurity incident doesn’t hit the news, whether it’s hackers accessing personal data, undertaking a DDoS attack or deploying ransomware. Over the years, security breaches have crippled industries, damaged businesses, shut people out of critical public and health databases, and caused chaos. You might think your company is protected as you use proprietary software. But it’s not so simple. Open source components and libraries are the foundation of literally every application in every industry, and the need to identify, track, and manage open source software security is more important than ever. Many people will remember what is arguable the worst cyberattack of 2017, upon Equifax, where hackers stole the personal information of 147.7 million Americans from its servers. Hackers used an Apache Struts vulnerability,a months-old issue that Equifax knew about but failed to fix.
