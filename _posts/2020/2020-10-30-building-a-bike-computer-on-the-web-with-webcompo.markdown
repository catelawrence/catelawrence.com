Passion projects offer a great opportunity to learn new skills and develop experience in pursuits you really enjoy. A keen cyclist, Filip Bech-Larse developed a trainer app that reads sensor-data via WebBluetooth from different sources, including Heart-rate, Speed, and Cadence. Filip is a front-end developer from Denmark, and the Head of Technology and Innovation at IMPACT, delivering large-scale commerce-products to well-known business and consumer brands. I spoke to him prior to his presentation at Codemotionâ€™s online conference: The Spanish edition about how he created the opportunity to learn WebComponents.
