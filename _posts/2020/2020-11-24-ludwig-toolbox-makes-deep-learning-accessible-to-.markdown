The last decade has seen exponential growth in deep learning capabilities and their application in research and development. Traditionally deep learning as a discipline has been limited to those with considerable training and knowledge of machine learning and AI. Fortunately, weâ€™ve seen the growth in efforts to democratize deep learning such as the creation ofLudwig toolbox, an open source, deep learning tool built on top of TensorFlow that allows users to train and test deep learning models without writing code.
