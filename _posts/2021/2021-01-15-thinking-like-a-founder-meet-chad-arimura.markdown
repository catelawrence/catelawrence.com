At Codemotion we’re fortunate to speak with a range of thinkers, leaders, and changemakers. At Codemotion Madrid 2019 we had a presentation by Chad Arimura. He’s a three-time entrepreneur, most recently as co-founder and CEO of Iron.io where he grew a multi-million dollar ARR business helping pioneer serverless computing including some of the earliest usages of the term “serverless” in 2010.
