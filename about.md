I'm an Australian based in Berlin. I work as a tech journalist, specializing in a range of topics with an emphasis on IIoT, IoT, robotics, wearables, health tech, open source, blockchain, AI, cybersecurity and mobile apps.

I also work with corporate clients and startup, writing and planning press releases, website copy, articles, presentations and in depth research.
